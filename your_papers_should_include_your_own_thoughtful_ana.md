**Theories and Ideas:**

All course work in MA Lead/MAEL courses needs to be evidence based. Key concepts from the texts and course readings should be used to provide a solid evidence base. Learners are expected to apply these theories and ideas to your areas of leadership specialization. It is the learners who must apply the leadership thinking to their specific work contexts and organizations.

**Leadership Application:**

All course work in MA Lead/MAEL courses should reflect the curriculum themes of

*   Transformational Servant Leadership
*   Values Based leadership
*   Leadership Competency Framework

Please review the 2017 Leadership Monograph to understand how we apply TSL, VBL and competencies to MA Lead and MAEL learning.

**Leadership Focus:**

All course work in MA Lead/MAEL courses should integrate our leadership focus on

*   People
*   Integrity
*   Results and
*   Innovation

Please review the 2017 Leadership Monograph to understand how we apply focused leadership to MA Lead and MAEL learning.

**Language, Grammar, and Editing:**

In your writing, use simple, straightforward language. Avoid using jargon or a complex sentence structure that detracts from the intent of your message. Please ensure that spelling and grammar is correct. Before submitting a paper, edit it yourself and if necessary, ask a proofreader to review it as well. Rewrite problematic sections.

**Structure and Presentation _of your References_**

The structure and organization of your papers should mirror the practices of other scholarly works in your field of study. ****When referencing sources, use the style outlined in the** APA 6 style guide. APA 6 is the official style guide for the MA in Leadership and MA in Educational Leadership programs**.****
