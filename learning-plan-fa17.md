**Week 7 – Team Assignment 2**

**Strategic Leadership Team Project \(15%\)**

**Strategic Directions – Sustain, Delete, Rethink and Add-Innovate**

**Team submissions Due Sunday June 17 at 23:59 PST**

This assignment is intended as an applied learning experience using SWOT in conjunction with either a _**‘brain storming’**_ process or the newer approach of **‘brain swarming’** to develop your information.

SWOT analysis is a long standing strategic process used successfully by various and varying organizations for many years. \(see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808)\)

SWOT Analysis however, is in declining use as are **Brain storming** processes \(see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v)\) , and its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to **group think**. \(see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMKK17EWXks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMKK17EWXks)\)

Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.

A newer process of **Brain Swarming** focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process included in ** Brain Swarming ** and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking. \(see [https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work](https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)\)

Brain swarming rejects gathering everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment not necessarily suitable for everyone. While **Brain Storming** is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, **Brain Swarming** asks:

**Why do we need to talk in the first place?**

##### How brain swarming works:

* Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.
* Inputs are sought from each team – there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team
* Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. \(see [https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work](https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)\)

**Assignment Parameters**

Using Lepsinger's 6 Bridge Building Principles in "Closing the Execution Gap \(2010\) and Hughes, Beatty and Dunwoody's assessment tools for assessing organizational capacity for change in Becoming a Strategic Leader \(2014\) from Exhibits 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 \(pp. 130-133\) and the AAR six step process outlined on p. 134;

Assess the suggested strategies developed for the organization reviewed in your SWOT analysis of the organization chosen to determine the anticipated success or failure of the changes suggested for the organization's future practice and suggested strategies determined for change in the organization.

You can use a brainstorming or brain swarming approaches for reviewing the questions in the SWOT analysis. _\(Whichever tool your team uses is acceptable as long as the team is comfortable with the tool chosen – both are supplied for your review – direct any questions to me in the Q & A section of the course page if you experience any challenges with the process.\)_

Each team must submit the results of a SWOT analysis for an organization in line with the requirements mentioned above. The analysis will use Lepsinger’s \(2010\) 6 Bridge Builders \(pp. 25-203\) and the questions contained in Hughes, Beatty and Dinwoodie \(2014\) - Exhibits 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 \(pp. 130-133\) and the AAR six step process outlined on p. 134; to determine the success or failure of the organization to apply the changes discovered by the team in the SWOT Process.

The team LEAD _\(or a team agreed designate_\) will assign all materials related to team reviews and is responsible for submitting the finalized material in the PressBooks environment for grading.

The PressBooks material must include descriptive notes where the graphics do not explain the material fully and include clear referencing, citing all reference materials used in the exploration and conclusions for the materials covered.

**The Team Will:**

1. Select an organization to review using a SWOT analysis. _\(The organization can be fictional or actual that team members have awareness of.\)_
   1. For the purpose of time the choice and identity of the organization needs completion by the team for the middle of Week 3 _\(May 16\)_
2. The team will develop their SWOT Questions and arrange an interview with a significant leader of the organization forfor the end of week 4 _\(May 27\)_
3. The team will review interview responses and how they relate to the 4 quadrants by the end of Week 5 _\(June 3\)_

MA Lead/MAEL Grading Rubric for Assignments

In an effort to ensure consistency in the MA Lead/MAEL assignment of grades and to inform graduate students of assessments of the quality of work at the graduate level, the following interpretation of grades in assignments and courses offers a guideline.

| **Letter Grade** | **%** | **Grade** | **Meaning in Graduate Work**_**Note:**_** **_For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade._ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A+** | 95-100 | 4.3 | _**Exceptionally well-reasoned, compelling development of position**_. Outstanding incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Strikingly appropriate examples. Extraordinary insight, critical analytical and evaluative ability, and creativity. Superlative style and language usage. Makes an original contribution and is potentially publishable. |
| **A** | 90-94 | 4.0 | _**Well-argued and convincing development of position. Insightful**_ incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Notably appropriate examples. Excellent insight, critical analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Impressive style and language use. |
| **A-** | 85-89 | 3.7 | _**Thorough and plausible development of position**_. Skillful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Very good examples. Very good insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Commendable and fluent style and language usage. |
| **B+** | 80-84 | 3.3 | _**Proficient development of position**_. Appropriate incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Relevant examples. Good quality insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Clear and correct style and language usage. |
| **B** | 75-79 | 3.0 | _**Competent development of position, but possibly with some gaps and/or limitations**_. Satisfactory incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Satisfactory examples. Reasonable insight, analytic and evaluative ability. Little creativity. Generally satisfactory style and language usage, but possibly with some minor flaws. |
| **B-** | 70-74 | 2.7\* | _**Unimpressive development of position**_. Position not completely consistent with personal vision _or_ references and resources not taken fully into account _or_ examples are basic or not completely convincing _or_ lacking acceptable insight and analytic and evaluative ability. Style and language usage with weaknesses \(e.g., clarity, coherence, grammar\). Overall quality shows noticeable deficiencies. |
| **F** | &lt;70 | 2.0 | _**Unacceptable work at graduate level**_. Shows lack of understanding and/or competence in several of the criteria described above. _This grade is a failing grade at the graduate level, and students receiving a “C” course grade are required to re-take the course._ |

**Note: \* a grade of “B-“carries a GPA of 2.7. Learners require a composite GPA of 3.0 to graduate.**

**Other Designated Grades**

**INC** = **Incomplete**. A grade may be incomplete if assignments remain outstanding in a course or if the instructor has not yet submitted a grade. If assignments remain outstanding at the end of a course, students must obtain and complete an incomplete grade form from Enrollment Services.

**W** = **Withdrew**. This grade is assigned for students withdrawing during the first half of the course.

**WP /WF** = **Withdrew passing / Withdrew failing**. These grades are assigned to students withdrawing during the second half of a course. Grades are not computed into the cumulative GPA. A student may withdraw from a course only because of severe extenuating circumstances and if approval is granted by the Program Director and the Dean of Graduate Studies.
