<h4>Conflict and cooperation</h4>
<em><strong>Introduction</strong></em>

Conflict and cooperation are delicate balances in life and in developing organizational strategies. A poorly framed idea here, a flippant response to someone on the wrong day or wrong time and all cooperation and good will disappears quickly. Cooperation can help corporate strategies soar and achieve projections at unparalleled levels, while conflict can destroy any momentum an organization hopes to accomplish.

Your experience with cooperation and conflict may mirror the descriptions above. Seeing teams cooperate and make great strides in fulfilling corporate strategy and enhance mission, vision and values objectives and practice is exhilarating; making the environment enjoyable and the workplace somewhere you look forward to being. Conflict however, can do the opposite.
Even the smallest unresolved conflict in the workplace can bring all the momentum built by the team or organization to a grinding halt. Corporate strategy fizzles, mission, vision and values shift from practice to theory, with little passion for fulfillment as conflict drains energy, hope and desire for fulfilling any of the real goals envisioned.

You all have declared mission, vision and values focus for the organizations you work for. It may be practiced or simply posted on a wall or filed for future reference. You also have experienced conflict and its consequences within the organization as well.
