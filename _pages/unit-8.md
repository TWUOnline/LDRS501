<h2>Overview (draft)</h2>

<h3>Week 7</h3>

<h4>This week</h4>

This week introduces YOU to the topic of Conflict and Cooperation in our BLOG Forum &amp; the completion of your Strategic Applications Team Assignment.

This is another opportunity to interact in real time responses as we discuss how conflict and cooperation demonstrate a delicate balance in life and for developing organizational strategies. A poorly framed idea here, a flippant response to someone on the wrong day or wrong time and all cooperation and good will disappears quickly. Cooperation can help corporate strategies soar and achieve projections at unparalleled levels, while conflict can destroy any momentum an organization hopes to accomplish.

Your experience with cooperation and conflict may mirror the descriptions above. Seeing teams cooperate and make great strides in fulfilling corporate strategy and enhance mission, vision and values objectives and practice is exhilarating; making the environment enjoyable and the workplace somewhere you look forward to being. Conflict however, can do the opposite.
Even the smallest unresolved conflict in the workplace can bring all the momentum built by the team or organization to a grinding halt. Corporate strategy fizzles, mission, vision and values shift from practice to theory, with little passion for fulfillment as conflict drains energy, hope and desire for fulfilling any of the real goals envisioned.

You all have declared mission, vision and values focus for the organizations you work for. It may be practiced or simply posted on a wall or filed for future reference. You also have experienced conflict and its consequences within the organization as well. This is your week to wrestle through the implications in a BLOG format discussion to find solutions within the discussions for your organization or situations you may face in the future.

The TEAM Assignment focuses on Strategic Direction gleaned from your interviews, SWOT, processes used following those events and placing the material developed into the PressBooks environment. It is the culmination of all your TEAM work to date and provides the basis for new research done through your work with outside organizations, or fictional. This is the section where the book we are developing takes the most shape and introduced the most original research.

Instruction for the TEAM BLOG activity, TEAM Assignment 2 and  the PressBooks material appear below.

The PressBooks material follows previous outlines for developing proficiency with the material. (add new information below with an overview here)

<h4>Conflict and cooperation</h4>

<em><strong>Introduction</strong></em>

Conflict and cooperation are delicate balances in life and in developing organizational strategies. A poorly framed idea here, a flippant response to someone on the wrong day or wrong time and all cooperation and good will disappears quickly. Cooperation can help corporate strategies soar and achieve projections at unparalleled levels, while conflict can destroy any momentum an organization hopes to accomplish.

Your experience with cooperation and conflict may mirror the descriptions above. Seeing teams cooperate and make great strides in fulfilling corporate strategy and enhance mission, vision and values objectives and practice is exhilarating; making the environment enjoyable and the workplace somewhere you look forward to being. Conflict however, can do the opposite.
Even the smallest unresolved conflict in the workplace can bring all the momentum built by the team or organization to a grinding halt. Corporate strategy fizzles, mission, vision and values shift from practice to theory, with little passion for fulfillment as conflict drains energy, hope and desire for fulfilling any of the real goals envisioned.

You all have declared mission, vision and values focus for the organizations you work for. It may be practiced or simply posted on a wall or filed for future reference. You also have experienced conflict and its consequences within the organization as well.

<strong><em>This Week’s Question</em></strong>

For this week’s question, we focus on Lepsinger’s Bridge Builder # 6 (pp. 167-204).

</ul>

<ol>
<li>How has conflict affected the intended corporate practices within the organization and what is/was the impact to your experience within the organization or to the organization as a whole? (please do not use real names) </li>
</ol>

<ul>

</ul>

<ol>

<h4>WEEK 7– TEAM ASSIGNMENT 2 - STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP TEAM PROJECT (15%)</h4>

<strong>STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS – Sustain, Delete, Rethink and Add-Innovate</strong>

<em><strong>Team submissions Due Day 7 of Week 7 at 23:59 PST</strong></em>

This assignment is intended as an applied learning experience using SWOT in conjunction with either a ‘brain storming’ process or the ‘brain swarming’ to develop your information.

SWOT analysis is a long standing strategic process used successfully by various and varying organizations for many years. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808)

SWOT Analysis and Brain storming processes are in declining use around the world (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&amp;list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v) , and its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to group think. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==CWEvJciU0Zc&amp;t=13s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AXOSQT5yVQ)

Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.

A newer process of Brain Swarming focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process included in Brain Swarming and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)

Brain swarming rejects gathering everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment not necessarily suitable for everyone. While Brain Storming is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, Brain Swarming asks:

<em><strong>Why do we need to talk in the first place?</strong></em>

How Brain Swarming works:

<ul>
    <li>Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.</li>
    <li>Inputs are sought from each team – there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team</li>
    <li>Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)</li>
</ul>

<em><strong>Assignment Parameters</strong></em>

Using Lepsinger's 6 Bridge Building Principles in 'Closing the Execution Gap (2010) and Hughes, Beatty and Dunwoody's assessment tools for assessing organizational capacity for change in Becoming a Strategic Leader (2014) from Exhibits 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 (pp. 130-133) and the AAR six step process outlined on p. 134;

<ul>
    <li>Assess the suggested strategies developed for the organization reviewed in your SWOT analysis to determine the anticipated success or failure of the changes suggested for the organization's future practice and suggested strategies determined for change in the organization.</li>
    <li>You can use a brainstorming or brain swarming approaches for reviewing the questions in the SWOT analysis. (Whichever tool your team uses is acceptable as long as the team is comfortable with the tool chosen – both are supplied for your review – direct any questions to the instructor in the Q &amp; A section of the course page if you experience any challenges with process.)</li>
    <li>Each team must submit the results of a SWOT analysis for an organization in line with the requirements mentioned above.</li>
    <li>The analysis will use Lepsinger’s (2010) 6 Bridge Builders (pp. 25-203) and the questions contained in Hughes, Beatty and Dinwoodie (2014) - Exhibits 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 (pp. 130-133) and the AAR six step process outlined on p. 134; to determine the success or failure of the organization to apply the changes discovered by the team in the SWOT Process.</li>
    <li>The TEAM LEAD (or a team agreed designate) will assign all materials related to team reviews and is responsible for submitting the finalized material in the PressBooks environment for grading.</li>
    <li>The PressBooks material must include descriptive notes where the graphics do not explain the material fully and include clear referencing, citing all reference materials used in the exploration and conclusions for the materials covered.</li>
</ul>

THE TEAM WILL:

1) <em><strong>Select</strong> </em>an organization to review using a SWOT analysis. (The organization can be fictional or actual.)
a. For the purpose of time the choice and identity of the organization needs completion by the team for the middle of Week 3 (Day 3)
