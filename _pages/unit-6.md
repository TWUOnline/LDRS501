<h4>This week</h4>

This week introduces YOU to TEAM BLOGging.

This is where your and your TEAM will take an assigned position and prove it throughout the week. You may or may not agree with the position you are assigned to defend, but will need to create and defend the position for the other TEAM(S) to respond to. Instruction for the TEAM BLOG activity and  the PressBooks material appear below.

The PressBooks material follows previous outlines for developing proficiency with the material. (add new information below with an overview here)

You will find a wider variety of Learning Activities (6) this week as well. The first 4 weeks of the course focuses us on introducing newer concepts as you prepare and develop your research and questions to organizational leaders. The Learning Activites here, focus on thinking and insight into how people respond to differing experiences and environments. As you prepare and ask your questions, keep these lessons in mind to ensure you keep your personal bias to a minimum.

As we enter Week 6, I want to travel on a favourably oppositional safari.

Using your texts, your experiences and your well honed academic prowess, you will approach this week’s BLOG (BLOG 4 – Week 6) by providing favourable/oppositional views to the questions posed, substantively, succinctly and with citations from relevant supportive referencing to the view you present.

<em><strong>Here’s how we will handle the Week 6 BLOG.</strong> </em>

<span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;line-height: 22.4px;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px"><strong>NOTE: There are no Post Leaders this week.</strong> </span>

<span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;cursor: text;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">[Link to BLOG 4 - WEEK 6 Posting structures here]</span>

<ul>
    <li>Teams will post in ‘favour’ or ‘opposition’ to the premise of the question presented.</li>
    <li>You can post anytime between Day 1 @ 06:00 and Day 6 @ 23:59:59.</li>
    <li>The instructor will assign the team focus (‘favour’ or ‘opposition’) for all posts in the BLOG.</li>
</ul>

One TEAM member will speak in ‘favour,’ to support the question, the TEAM member from the opposite team will speak in ‘opposition’ to the question to disprove it.

<ul>
    <li>‘Favour’ teams will respond in ‘favour’ of the practices and premise laid out in the question and the texts substantively, succinctly and with citation of source materials.</li>
    <li>‘Opposition’ teams will ‘oppose’ the practices and premise laid out in the question and presented by the texts substantively, succinctly and with citation of source materials.</li>
</ul>

The parameters remain the same for all BLOGS.

<ul>
    <li>There are no individual posts.</li>
    <li>You will submit three (3) posts per team for the week.</li>
    <li>They will be substantive, succinct and cited.</li>
</ul>

The team assignments for this week will be assigned by the Saturday prior to the beginning of Week 6:

The question you will respond to in this week's TEAM BLOG is as follows:.

<ul>
    <li>Chapter 5 of Lepsinger’s Closing the Execution Gap (pp. 133-166) entitled Bridge Builder 5: Facilitate Change Readiness outlines several principles for how top performing companies handle change initiatives (pp. 133-141), what addicts can teach us about change (pp. 141-145), change level appropriate strategies (pp. 145-154) and understanding the Impact of leader behaviour (pp. 154-166).</li>
</ul>

Your answers will include materials from the Lepsinger text and at least two (2) other course texts and at least one (1) outside source not listed in course materials.

<h4>Team Posts</h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>For your first TEAM post</strong>, you will choose one of the sections from Chapter 5 above and write in favour/opposition of the principle you focus on. The principle must be fully addressed by stating why the principles reviewed are important factors for the section you review. (i.e. if there are 4 points to the section you focus on, every point must receive a favourable/oppositional review on how it helps/hinders organizational change)</li>
    <li><strong>Your second TEAM post</strong> will respond favourably/opposed to the first post by Team(s) addressing their favour/opposition to the section in chapter 5 they responded to.</li>
    <li><strong>Your third TEAM post</strong> will review all post materials from the week and provide a summary of your favour/opposition for all sections reviewed in previous posts and the Team favour/opposition position for all sections reviewed in previous posts.</li>
</ul>

Once you summarize your position, make one final summary paragraph listing the top three reasons you believe your assigned position proves/disproves the principles reviewed.

Substantive, Succinct and Cited
