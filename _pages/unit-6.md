<h4>Blog 6.1 (team blog - <strong>5%</strong>)</h4>
This week introduces you to team blogging.

This is where your and your team will take an assigned position and prove it throughout the week. You may or may not agree with the position you are assigned to defend, but will need to create and defend the position for the other team(S) to respond to. Instruction for the team blog activity appear below.

<ol>
 	<li>assessed yourself as a Strategic Leader. (Assignment 1)</li>
 	<li>discussed the tools and thinking associated with servant and strategic leadership for organizational development. (Post 2.1)</li>
 	<li>presently discussing Strategic Leadership Teams and how to build them and respond to the challenges they represent. (Post 3.1)</li>
 	<li>measured and responded to strategy renewal, execution and organizational design principles in your organizational and personal practice.</li>
 	<li>submitted your first team Assignment. <em>(It should be graded and returned by now.)</em></li>
</ol>
As we continue into Week 6, I want to travel on a favourably oppositional safari.

Using your texts, your experiences and your well honed academic prowess, you will approach this week’s blog (Post 6.1) by providing favourable/oppositional views to the questions posed, substantively, succinctly and with citations from relevant supportive referencing to the view you present.
<h3>Question</h3>
Chapter 5 of Lepsinger’s Closing the Execution Gap (pp. 133-166) entitled Bridge Builder 5: Facilitate Change Readiness outlines several principles for how top performing companies handle change initiatives (pp. 133-141), what addicts can teach us about change (pp. 141-145), change level appropriate strategies (pp. 145-154) and understanding the Impact of leader behaviour (pp. 154-166).

Your answers will include materials from the Lepsinger text and at least two (2) other course texts and at least one (1) outside source not listed in course materials.
<h4>Here’s how we will handle Post 6.1.</h4>
<span style="float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #333333; font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 22.4px; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px;"><strong>NOTE: There are no Post Leaders this week.</strong> </span>
<h5>Step 1</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Prior to the beginning of week 6, the instructor will assign the team focus (‘favour’ or ‘opposition’) for all team posts.</li>
 	<li>Each team will post on one member's blog a cooperatively written argument either in favour or opposition to the premise provided.
<ul>
 	<li>You will choose one of the sections from Chapter 5 above and write in favour/opposition of the principle you focus on. The principle must be fully addressed by stating why the principles reviewed are important factors for the section you review. (i.e. if there are 4 points to the section you focus on, every point must receive a favourable/oppositional review on how it helps/hinders organizational change)</li>
 	<li>Posts must be presented substantively, succinctly and with citation of source materials.</li>
 	<li>You may want to add each team member to each other's blogs to assist with cooperating on this activity, alternately, you may use a web-based collaborative document to compose your response. We recommend using Etherpad at <a href="https://apps.opened.ca">apps.opened.ca</a> so that you can avoid sending your personal information to Google.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Step 1 should be completed by by the end of the day on Wednesday of Week 6.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h5>Step 2</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Each team will respond to the opposing team's OP (original post) with a rebuttal of their argument.</li>
 	<li>Step 2 should be completed by by the end of the day on Friday of Week 6.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h5>Step 3</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Each team will post counter-arguments to the rebuttals posted in step 2.</li>
 	<li>Each team will summarize their view in a 1 paragraph closing statement.</li>
 	<li>Step 3 should be completed by the end of the day on Sunday of week 6.</li>
</ul>
Categories for this post:
<ul>
 	<li>ldrs501</li>
 	<li>'favour conclusion' or 'opposition conclusion' (according to your team's assigned role)</li>
</ul>
The parameters remain the same for all posts for this week.
<ul>
 	<li>There are no individual posts. You will post as a team on one blog, but your posts must be cooperatively composed.</li>
 	<li>Each team will submit three (3) posts for the week.</li>
 	<li>Posts will be substantive, succinct and cited.</li>
</ul>
