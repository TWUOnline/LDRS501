<h4>IMPLICATIONS AND CHALLENGES IN STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP</h4>
<strong>Leading Strategically</strong>

<em>“Seeing things the way God sees them”</em>

<strong>Principle:</strong> Hope for future

Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the LORD's purpose that prevails. Proverbs 19: 21

<em><strong>EMPOWERING PUBLIC CULTURE</strong></em>

When empowering public culture, there are several principles for ensuring success. The seminal work on the subject, <em>Inside the learning society</em> by Stewart Ranson (1998) outlines several principles important to the practice of empowering a learning society in the public culture. in general, there needs to be a resistance to organizational democratization. In other words, the life of free enterprise beyond government controls is a central tenet of the learning society. Reliance on governmental oversight to reign in organizations to fit within the democratized vision of a city, country or region will not help build effective response to ongoing learning and organizational vitality.

Priority consideration to justice and citizenship needs are imperative. The citizenry (corporate and private) need to address their dependence on governmental directives and take responsibility for developing characteristic learning habits that challenge the government's forward momentum versus staying in lock-step. Some of the characteristics posited by Ranson (1998) about the change a learning society must experience include:
<ol>
 	<li>Learning how it is changing in context with learning previously characterized as trends and accepted as status quo.</li>
 	<li>Changing what it has to learn. Not dependent on others, but asking questions and seeking answers and beyond past experience.</li>
 	<li>Learning how to change. Educating themselves on different ways of approaching challenges (corporately and privately) to promote necessary momentum toward future understanding and breakthrough.</li>
 	<li>Changing the way they learn. It is often said; if you do the same thing over and over and expect different results, it is the trademark of insanity. Similarly, freedom through changing the way, the approach, the practice of learning opens up vast opportunities where differing results is progress, not just happenstance as a result of doing the same things over and over.</li>
 	<li>Involving all members in learning new ways of doing things. Understanding what they are learning. What demands are placed on everyone as they engage in greater learning and a commitment to independence.</li>
 	<li>Learning to change requires an understanding of the changing conditions of learning. Knowing the characteristics for an effective learning system is a good starting point in taking responsibility for adopting new learning practices. Knowing the forms and limits knowledge operates in helps enhance new learning processes.</li>
</ol>
Priority consideration to justice and citizenship needs is central to the commitment to learning and focusing on what it means to learn as an independent entity and is central to the citizenry being entitled to shape the future. Ranson (1998) again posits the  need for new vision 'to express the value of and conditions for a learning society.' (p. 254) The independent society adopts learning values and opportunities to further citizenry (corporate and private) development to develop and promote the following substantive and defining characteristics:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>The exhibit collective change:</strong> Learning about itself, how it changes and what changes are needed to how it learns;</li>
 	<li><strong>Agency is evident:</strong> Agency encourages active participation in helping communities understand their greatest strength comes from learning how to effectively act, engage and excel together.</li>
 	<li><strong>Opening avenues of dialogue:</strong> Enabling conversation brings <span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;cursor: text;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">differences in values and beliefs </span>to the surface for critical evaluation;</li>
 	<li><strong>Democratic thinking and development: </strong>Learns the conditions for active citizenship helps a society understand the importance in creating the institutional forms of participative democracy.</li>
</ul>
For a society to truly be defined as a learning society it must satisfy <span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;cursor: text;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">the litmus test</span> of public interest. A test where individuals are motivated to learn. Understanding that learning has purpose, and they take responsibility for achieving the ends involved in the process. 'The motivation to learn is internal to the purpose of learning in realising the distinctive qualities of the self as agent. The rewards of learning are intrinsic to the process of enhancing personal capacities to standards of excellence.' (Ranson, Martin, Nixon and McKeown 1996).

For structuring government toward becoming a learning society Stiglitz and Greenwald (2014) , capitalize heavily on the recognition of effective social constructs for forwarding the learning society concept. Defining the constructs broadly to mean those beliefs emerging spontaneously from the collective learning of the society and linked to the common behaviours defined within the system(s) defining the learned constructs. (p. 460). Changing perception of powerlessness to empowerment goes a long way in transforming constructs of defeat to introducing constructs of possibility and success within the society. As Stiglitz and Greenwald note (p. 461):
<blockquote>
<div>Those who think that they will not do well won’t in fact do well. if one believes that change is not possible, or that most changes are for the worse, then one won’t undertake actions that facilitate and promote change.</div></blockquote>
<div>Conversely, those thinking they will do well, will do well. Those who believe positive change is possible, will pursue and take the necessary actions to facilitate and promote positive change. The focus toward societal constructs makes the difference.</div>
<blockquote>
<div>'Just as beliefs affect individual actions and performance, widely held beliefs affect collective actions.' (Stiglitz and Greenwald, p. 461)</div></blockquote>
<div>Societal belief systems affect governmental policy and in turn effective societal learning. Governments need to set a clear communicative agenda on what they believe to influence the greater society and citizenry (corporate and private) toward fulfilling the messages of hope able to change the social constructs held and/or holding back societal learning. Understanding how systems change—and how governments can influence systemic change gives us a glimpse into the dynamics of creating a learning society. If the government uses information and education toward a learning society to maintain power over the citizenry versus empower them, the opportunities for creating a learning society can be hampered by the very system trying to engage it. (p. 464)</div>
<div></div>
<div>But for a learning society to prosper, services must be shaped at the point of consumption. In other words, the society must learn from the place of empowerment; not control. A democratic approach to societal development allows the society to challenge previously accepted norms and create new constructs to define them, versus being tied to what always was. In this way, the society learns to navigate and develop ways to learn as the restrictions are removed or non-existent; with one caveat.</div>
<div>
<blockquote>Unfortunately, even if in the long run, a more dynamic society benefits most members of society, in the short run, there can be (and normally will be) losers. And not surprisingly, those who might lose seek to prevent such changes through any means they can. (Stiglitz and Greenwald, p. 466)</blockquote>
This is where the call of a learning society, must also commit to developing an ethical citizenship culture. Ethical citizenship starts with relationships and relationship building. William K. Dustin (1999) supports this thinking when he says; 'It is through relationships that we as individuals participate in the process of living and contribute, either positively or negatively.' (p. 5) He continues with a larger palette on relational thinking.

For Dustin, relationships are not simply with one another, or with the environment we live in. Relationships travel beyond what we expect and delve deeply into the 'intangible realm of ideas.' (p. 6) Affecting views of citizenship at the deepest level. Establishing an <span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;line-height: 22.4px;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">ethical context to create </span>the balance and harmony needed to achieve 'democratic ideals.' (p. 6) When citizenship become our highest ethos, as citizen first 'with a secondary role as private person, the ideals of democracy will become achievable.' (p. 7) The important thing is to get from where you are to where you want to be.

Louis Carroll, in his classic <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>, describes an exchange between the fictional Alice and the fantastical Cheshire Cat.

</div>
<blockquote>
<div>'Please,' she said, 'can you tell me which way to go from here?'
'But where do you want to get to?” said the Cat.
'It doesn't really matter -.' began Alice.
'Then it doesn’t matter which way you go.' said the Cat.
'But I would like to get somewhere.' Alice explained.
“If you just go on walking” said the Cat, “in the end you'll arrive somewhere.” (pp. 20, 21)</div></blockquote>
<div><strong>Finding your way as leader</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Finding your way as a leader is an important focus for everyone aspiring to lead. At Trinity we teach and focus on Transformational Servant leadership. The Master of Arts in Leadership/Master of Arts in Educational Leadership Monograph (2018) is a great resource for this topic. It has many great articles and references to help anyone find their way as the leader they desire to be. Monograph 2 - Transformational Servant Leadership (pp. 7-19) provides an outline of the materials and references we focus on to help each learner find their way as a leader.</div>

<div><strong>Two Final Devotional Thoughts</strong></div>
<div>As we close this section of reading for the Reading Break, I want to close with two devotional thoughts you can mediate on. One is from the Bible (Jeremiah 19: 11-13), regarding how God sees us and invites us to find him in our lives and challenges. The other is the Serenity Prayer, widely associated with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), where each meeting begins and ends with the prayer. I hope you will gain inspiration as you read through these two devotional thoughts.</div>
<div><strong><span style="text-align: left;color: #333333;line-height: 22.4px;text-indent: 0px;letter-spacing: normal;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;float: none;background-color: transparent">Jeremiah 19: 11- 13</span><i></i><u></u></strong></div>
<div>“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Serenity Prayer</strong></div>
God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
