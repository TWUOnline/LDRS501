<h4>IMPLICATIONS AND CHALLENGES IN STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP</h4>
<strong>Leading Strategically</strong>

<em>“Seeing things the way God sees them”</em>

<strong>Principle:</strong> Hope for future

Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the LORD's purpose that prevails. Proverbs 19: 21

<em><strong>EMPOWERING PUBLIC CULTURE</strong></em>

When empowering public culture, there are several principles for ensuring success. The seminal work on the subject, <em>Inside the learning society</em> by Stewart Ranson (1998) outlines several principles important to the practice of empowering a learning society in the public culture. in general, there needs to be a resistance to organizational democratization. In other words, the life of free enterprise beyond government controls is a central tenet of the learning society. Reliance on governmental oversight to reign in organizations to fit within the democratized vision of a city, country or region will not help build effective response to ongoing learning and organizational vitality.

Priority consideration to justice and citizenship needs are imperative. The citizenry (corporate and private) need to address their dependence on governmental directives and take responsibility for developing characteristic learning habits that challenge the government's forward momentum versus staying in lock-step. Some of the characteristics posited by Ranson (1998) about the change a learning society must experience include:
<ol>
 	<li>Learning how it is changing in context with learning previously characterized as trends and accepted as status quo.</li>
 	<li>Changing what it has to learn. Not dependent on others, but asking questions and seeking answers and beyond past experience.</li>
 	<li>Learning how to change. Educating themselves on different ways of approaching challenges (corporately and privately) to promote necessary momentum toward future understanding and breakthrough.</li>
 	<li>Changing the way they learn. It is often said; if you do the same thing over and over and expect different results, it is the trademark of insanity. Similarly, freedom through changing the way, the approach, the practice of learning opens up vast opportunities where differing results is progress, not just happenstance as a result of doing the same things over and over.</li>
 	<li>Involving all members in learning new ways of doing things. Understanding what they are learning. What demands are placed on everyone as they engage in greater learning and a commitment to independence.</li>
 	<li>Learning to change requires an understanding of the changing conditions of learning. Knowing the characteristics for an effective learning system is a good starting point in taking responsibility for adopting new learning practices. Knowing the forms and limits knowledge operates in helps enhance new learning processes.</li>
</ol>
Priority consideration to justice and citizenship needs is central to the commitment to learning and focusing on what it means to learn as an independent entity and is central to the citizenry being entitled to shape the future. Ranson (1998) again posits the  need for new vision 'to express the value of and conditions for a learning society.' (p. 254) The independent society adopts learning values and opportunities to further citizenry (corporate and private) development to develop and promote the following substantive and defining characteristics:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>The exhibit collective change:</strong> Learning about itself, how it changes and what changes are needed to how it learns;</li>
 	<li><strong>Agency is evident:</strong> Agency encourages active participation in helping communities understand their greatest strength comes from learning how to effectively act, engage and excel together.</li>
 	<li><strong>Opening avenues of dialogue:</strong> Enabling conversation brings <span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;cursor: text;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">differences in values and beliefs </span>to the surface for critical evaluation;</li>
 	<li><strong>Democratic thinking and development: </strong>Learns the conditions for active citizenship helps a society understand the importance in creating the institutional forms of participative democracy.</li>
</ul>
For a society to truly be defined as a learning society it must satisfy <span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;cursor: text;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">the litmus test</span> of public interest. A test where individuals are motivated to learn. Understanding that learning has purpose, and they take responsibility for achieving the ends involved in the process. 'The motivation to learn is internal to the purpose of learning in realising the distinctive qualities of the self as agent. The rewards of learning are intrinsic to the process of enhancing personal capacities to standards of excellence.' (Ranson, Martin, Nixon and McKeown 1996).

CHALLENGE
“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where.” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go.” said the Cat.
(cont’d)
CHALLENGE
“So long as I get somewhere.” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that.” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”
Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland
Finding your way as leader
“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. Jeremiah 19: 11- 13
Serenity Prayer

God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
