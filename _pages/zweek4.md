Here is your outline of materials for Week 4 and links to the materials needed to review, develop and learn further principles for Strategic Leadership.

This week introduces arious aspects of strategic team development and other strategic leadership concepts. YOU can follow the Link to BLOG 3 (Strategy renewal, execution and organizational design) to interact with fellow learners and develop an understanding around the Leadership Imperatives &amp; Strategic Leadership ideas requested in BLOG 3.

As in your introductory BLOG, you are free to use the skills learned in the orientation to the WordPress process for making your BLOG come alive. Whether it is text alone, text and pictures, video, sound bite or a combination of all approaches. Make your BLOG as unforgettable as possible so people remember what you say and set you apart from other unique leaders in the field.

Following BLOG  instructions, there is another Reading Overview related to specific materials covered in the coming week of the course, followed by 6 Learning outcomes for the unit, with further BLOG and Assignment instructions (TEAM Assignment 2) for you to review in the week ahead.

Finally, the section outlines not just one Learning Activity for the week, but five (5). These Learning Activities provide a capstone to your mastery of topical material related to Strategy renewal, execution and organizational design. From this point forward, all Learning Activities from Week 6 through Week 10 will focus on your mastery of PressBooks material and your ability to add to the Open Resource materials we are developing together.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Following the activities outlined for Week 4, comes Reading Week (Week 5), where you can catch up on reading and assignment requirements without engaging in the course BLOG or submit graded materials for the week. There are some activities available in the Week 5 section for you to engage in as you continue your Strategic Leadership journey, but those activities are ungraded, with graded assignments continuing following the Week 5 break.
