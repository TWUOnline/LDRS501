<h5>Learning Activity for Appreciative Inquiry (AI)</h5>

For the Learning Activity in this section, you will conduct an AI interview with your team (2-3 people), following the instructions outlined below.

<ul>
<li>Gather together as a team (via Skype, Zoom, Google Hangouts, FaceTime, etc.) and ask each other the following questions.</li>
<li>Record your answers to one another to compare and discuss your answers afterwards.</li>
</ul>

Suggested questions for interviews_(adapted from OESC Trustee Professional Development Program)_:

<ol>
<li>What motivated you to enter your present career?</li>
<li>What do you value most about being involved in your present career pursuits and the larger mission this represents?</li>
<li>Think back to your most significant leadership experience you have had in your career.</li>
<li>A time when you felt really alive, engaged, and proud of yourself and your performance? Describe the experience.</li>
<li>What strengths surrounded you?</li>
<li>What values were at play?</li>
<li>How has this experience influenced you in your role today?</li>
<li>Think back to a successful project or activity that was particularly satisfying in terms of teamwork or a collective achievement. A moment or period where you felt you made a real difference because of the collaboration among the group.</li>
<li>Describe that time.</li>
<li>What are the one or two reasons you felt engaged?</li>
<li>What contributed to this being a peak experience?</li>
<li>What made the team effective?</li>
<li>What do you think was your own most valuable contribution to the team?</li>
<li>What does your present employer do to promote these types of experiences?</li>
<li>If you could make three wishes you, the people you work with and your present employer to evolve to their full potential as a team, what would those wishes be?</li>
<li>What single small change can you make to have the biggest impact in improving your work environment right now?</li>
</ol>

<strong>Whole Group Sharing and Storytelling</strong>

After your group’s interviews are complete, share your responses with one another and make meaning out of what you've learned.

Follow up questions for discussion:

<ol>
<li>What did you find most surprising in your interviews?</li>
<li>What are your team’s greatest strengths (as gleaned from your interviews with one another)?</li>
<li>What are some of the key factors for a successful team you possess together? (List as many as you discover)</li>
<li>What values do you have in common? (List at least three, but no more than 5)</li>
<li>What are the group’s aspirations for this team as a result of what you've learned about each other through the interview process?</li>
<li>how will you incorporate what you've learned from this exercise into the team practices required to publish the Open Source Strategic Leadership Book required in completing this course?</li>
</ol>

Once you answer these questions, record them somewhere to refer to them throughout your work together and remind you of the important concepts and principles you've discovered in this process.
