* All posts will require substantive response* to ALL questions asked in the blog (One 6 part question for Week 3) in the following pattern.

**Blog 2 – Week 3 - POST LEADERS**

* First blog posting is limited to the first team members from the cohort _(one [1] from each team represented in the learning cohort)_ who post a substantive response to the questions posed AFTER 6 am of Day 1 of Week 3.
* First posters _(one [1] from each team represented in the learning cohort)_ become the post leaders for the week and must post their first response to the questions posed fully and completely by Monday 23:59:59 of Week 3.

### Substantive Responses and Participation ...

**Involves** the following:

* Shows deep higher order processing of relevant ideas.
* Provides tremendous opportunity to build upon one another’s knowledge, insights, and experience.
* Allows all members of the cohort to collaborate effectively regarding ideas shared in the forum.
* Will, at times, lead to respectful challenging each other’s perceptions, ideas and assumptions.
* Provides rich dialogue in the learning process.
* Provides the opportunity for building a supportive subculture of encouragement for one another through shared ideas and challenging discourse.
* Allows participants to focus on addressing the questions at hand fully and completely. Disagreeing and challenging one another based on the material under review and investigation so as to stimulate and edifying one another through the pure pursuit of the best information within the best framework of discussion – forum discussion questions (DQ).

**May** include _(among other things)_:

* Providing and developing a new thought, idea, or perspective.
* Citing an experience or example of what we are learning and showing how it applies.
* Adding a new twist on a perspective.
* Critically reflecting on an idea/concept.
* Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective and giving reasons for your questioning

Is **NOT**:

* Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree.”
* Restating what has already been said (unless there is a direct purpose in doing so).
* Disrespectfully disagreeing.
* Pat answers that are not thought - provoking

Below are _**examples**_ of how to stimulate your thinking and the thinking of others when looking for new and unique approaches to a line of study, questioning or argumentation.

* What would happen if we looked at this from this perspective...?
* Other times it may be helpful to ignore the obvious and look into the less obvious answers to the question...
* My consideration leads me to believe that...what is your experience with this?
* You might want to approach this from this point of view...
* Is it possible that...
* Would you consider a different view...?
* Maybe...
* Possibly...
* Sometimes...
* I'm wondering if...
* Do you think...
* Perhaps…
