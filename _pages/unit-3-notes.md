<h3>Substantive Responses and Participation  ...</h3>

    <li>Will, at times, lead to respectful challenging each other’s perceptions, ideas and assumptions.</li>
    <li>Provides rich dialogue in the learning process.</li>
    <li>Provides the opportunity for building a supportive subculture of encouragement for one another through shared ideas and challenging discourse.</li>
    <li>Allows participants to focus on addressing the questions at hand fully and completely. Disagreeing and challenging one another based on the material under review and investigation so as to stimulate and edifying one another through the pure pursuit of the best information within the best framework of discussion – forum discussion questions (DQ).</li>
</ul>

<strong>May</strong> include <em>(among other things)</em>:

<ul>
    <li>Providing and developing a new thought, idea, or perspective.</li>
    <li>Citing an experience or example of what we are learning and showing how it applies.</li>
    <li>Adding a new twist on a perspective.</li>
    <li>Critically reflecting on an idea/concept.</li>
    <li>Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective and giving reasons for your questioning</li>

    <li>Disrespectfully disagreeing.</li>

</ul>

Below are <em><strong>examples</strong> </em>of how to stimulate your thinking and the thinking of others when looking for new and unique approaches to a line of study, questioning or argumentation.

<ul>
    <li>What would happen if we looked at this from this perspective...?</li>
    <li>Other times it may be helpful to ignore the obvious and look into the less obvious answers to the question...</li>
    <li>My consideration leads me to believe that...what is your experience with this?</li>
    <li>You might want to approach this from this point of view...</li>
    <li>Is it possible that...</li>
    <li>Would you consider a different view...?</li>
    <li>Maybe...</li>
    <li>Possibly...</li>
    <li>Sometimes...</li>

</ul>

<h4>TEAM Assignment 2 Resource Notes</h4>

The following resources will assist you in preparing for and completing TEAM Assignment 2

<h4><strong>SWOT</strong></h4>

SWOT analysis is a long standing strategic process used successfully by various and varying organizations for many years. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808)

SWOT Analysis and Brain storming processes are in declining use around the world (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&amp;list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v) , and its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to group think. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==CWEvJciU0Zc&amp;t=13s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AXOSQT5yVQ)

Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.

<h4><strong>Brain Swarming</strong></h4>

A newer process of Brain Swarming focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process included in Brain Swarming and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)

Brain swarming rejects gathering everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment not necessarily suitable for everyone. While Brain Storming is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, Brain Swarming asks:
Why do we need to talk in the first place?

<strong>How Brain Swarming works:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.</li>
    <li>Inputs are sought from each team – there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team</li>
    <li>Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)</li>
</ul>
