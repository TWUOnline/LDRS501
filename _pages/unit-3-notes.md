<li>Provides the opportunity for building a supportive subculture of encouragement for one another through shared ideas and challenging discourse.</li>
<li>Allows participants to focus on addressing the questions at hand fully and completely. Disagreeing and challenging one another based on the material under review and investigation so as to stimulate and edifying one another through the pure pursuit of the best information within the best framework of discussion – forum discussion questions (DQ).</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<li>Other times it may be helpful to ignore the obvious and look into the less obvious answers to the question...</li>
<li>My consideration leads me to believe that...what is your experience with this?</li>
<li>You might want to approach this from this point of view...</li>
<li>Is it possible that...</li>
<li>Would you consider a different view...?</li>
<li>Maybe...</li>
<li>Possibly...</li>
