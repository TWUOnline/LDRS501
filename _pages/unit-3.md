## Strategic Leadership Teams

### Week 3

This week introduces YOU to an understanding of Systems Thinking dynamics as it relates to Strategic Leadership. We will review three important concepts from the Systems Thinking realm and add more instruction around the PressBooks platform. The concepts we will review include:

* Senge's Laws for System Thinking. This section outlines Senge's work from his book, **_The Fifth Discipline_**, (2006).

* 5 additional laws to consider to expand our thinking on the topic.

* Organizational Learning Disabilities hindering the effective development and practice of Systems Thinking.

Systems Thinking is an important part of Strategic Leadership development. Addressing healthy concepts, understanding the pitfalls associated with poor practice and assessing the ability or disability issues in Systems Thinking practice can improve your practice of Strategic Leadership principles and concepts.

The PressBooks material follows previous outlines for developing proficiency with the material. * More PressBooks instruction to prepare you further for the TEAM elements of the book preparation process.(add new information below with an overview here)

&lt;h4&gt;TEAM Assignment 2 Resource Notes&lt;/h4&gt;

The following resources will assist you in preparing for and completing TEAM Assignment 2

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SWOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

SWOT analysis is a long standing strategic process used successfully by various and varying organizations for many years. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808)

SWOT Analysis and Brain storming processes are in declining use around the world (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&amp;list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v) , and its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to group think. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==CWEvJciU0Zc&amp;t=13s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AXOSQT5yVQ)

Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Swarming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

A newer process of Brain Swarming focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process included in Brain Swarming and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)

Brain swarming rejects gathering everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment not necessarily suitable for everyone. While Brain Storming is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, Brain Swarming asks:
Why do we need to talk in the first place?

&lt;strong&gt;How Brain Swarming works:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inputs are sought from each team – there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)&lt;/li&gt;
