## Strategic Leadership Teams

### Week 3

This week introduces you to an understanding of Systems Thinking dynamics as it relates to Strategic Leadership. We will review three important concepts from the Systems Thinking realm and add more instruction around the PressBooks platform. The concepts we will review include:

* Senge's Laws for System Thinking. This section outlines Senge's work from his book, **_The Fifth Discipline_**, (2006).

* 5 additional laws to consider to expand our thinking on the topic.

* Organizational Learning Disabilities hindering the effective development and practice of Systems Thinking.

Systems Thinking is an important part of Strategic Leadership development. Addressing healthy concepts, understanding the pitfalls associated with poor practice and assessing the ability or disability issues in Systems Thinking practice can improve your practice of Strategic Leadership principles and concepts.

The PressBooks material follows previous outlines for developing proficiency with the material. * More PressBooks instruction to prepare you further for the team elements of the book preparation process.(add new information below with an overview here)
