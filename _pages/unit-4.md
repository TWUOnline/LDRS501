1. Appreciative Inquiry

2. More PressBooks instruction to prepare you further for the TEAM elements of the book preparation process.

The Appreciative Inquiry concepts are an important framework for Strategic Leadership. Looking at things from a more positive light is a better framework for developing strategy than developing it to fix problems in the organization. When we become fixers we run into a never ending list of fixes to attend to. When we become dreamers, we see the future as an open book with dreams, wishes and opportunities laid before us to work toward and succeed at.

The PressBooks material follows previous outlines for developing proficiency with the material. \(add new information below with an overview here\)
