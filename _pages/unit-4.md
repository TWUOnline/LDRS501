## Overview

### Week 3 \(change before closing\)

TEAM Assignments will be announced this week, based on the results of Week 1 Assignment. Teams will consist of teams of 3.

This week also introduces YOU and understanding team dynamics as it relates to Strategic Leadership. We will review two important concepts forrn

1. Appreciative Inquiry

2. More PressBooks instruction to prepare you further for the TEAM elements of the book preparation process.

The Appreciative Inquiry concepts are an important framework for Strategic Leadership. Looking at things from a more positive light is a better framework for developing strategy than developing it to fix problems in the organization. When we become fixers we run into a never ending list of fixes to attend to. When we become dreamers, we see the future as an open book with dreams, wishes and opportunities laid before us to work toward and succeed at.

The PressBooks material follows previous outlines for developing proficiency with the material. \(add new information below with an overview here\)

##### BLOG 2 – Week 3: Strategic Leadership Teams

This week’s DQ involves portions of all four texts from your reading in Week 2, plus any other relevant resources you wish to add to the discussion. Please answer substantively to the whole question \(all parts\). Please be as succinct as possible, but be complete. Please cite all references. \(Substantive/succinct/cited\)

Galbraith – Formal Groups pp. 90-106.; Hughes et al. – Chapter 5 – Strategic Leadership Teams; Lepsinger – Bridge 3 – pp. 14-16; M. Ungerer, G. Ungerer & J. Herholdt – Chapters 3-5 \(pp. 107-275\).

Assessing your present/previous team situation or course team environment \(see Hughes, et al., p. 213\), did you/are you perform/performing effectively as a team to access all the diverse leadership perspectives? Why do you say so? Why not?

As you work with teams in your present/previous work environment and your team in this course, how do you build a sense of ownership and involvement?

What are some of the limiting factors in the team systems you’ve worked with or work with presently?

How do you identify bottlenecks in your present/previous team situation or course team environment? How do you address those issues without shutting down team creativity, efficiency or cohesiveness?

Using the Formal Groups section of Galbraith’s Designing Organizations text, identify the design choices in your present/previous working environment and compare it to the design choices you made for the function of your teams in this course?

* How are they similar?

* How are they different?

* What do you see needing improvement in both to make them more effective?

How do YOU suggest building an effective Strategic Leadership team in your present environment based on your reading and present/previous team experiences?

* How will YOU deal with the struggles an SLT can face as it develops and takes on challenges in the working/course environments around you? 

NOTE:

1. ALL BLOGs start with post leaders \(see posting instructions\). 
2. ALL posts \(leaders and responders\) must answer substantively, succinctly and cited. 
3. ALL posts must be started and completed in the time frames provided in posting instructions. 

If you have questions, please do not hesitate to ask. We are learning together. Mastery comes from learning, not vice versa.

#### Unit 4 Learning Activities

##### Learning Activity 4.1

##### Systems Thinking

**A Systems Thinking Primer: **_**Seeing Organizations in Action**_

Five Disciplines of a Learning Organization - Peter Senge

_\(see Zeeman, A. \(2017\). Senge’s Five Disciplines of Learning Organizations. Retrieved \[insert date\] from ToolsHero: _[https://www.toolshero.com/management/five-disciplines-learning-organizations/](https://www.toolshero.com/management/five-disciplines-learning-organizations/)_ for an effective summary of this seminal book related to Systems Thinking\)_

Stephen Haines writes that a system is “a set of components that work together for the overall objective of the whole.” \(p. 17\)

In Senge's _The fifth discipline_, Senge outlines his fundamentals for systems thinking.

**Today's problems come from yesterday’s solutions**

Senge notes, 'we merely need to look at our own solutions to other problems in the past.' \(p. 57\)

Explaining that problems arise from past actions.

> A well-established firm may find that this quarter's sales are off sharply. Why? Because the highly successful rebate program last quarter led many customers to buy then rather than now. Or a new manager attacks chronically high inventory costs and "solves" the problem—except that the salesforce is now spending 20 percent more time responding to angry complaints from customers who are still waiting for late shipments, and the rest of its time trying to convince prospective customers that they can have "any color they want so long as it's black. \(Senge. pp. 57, 58\)

**The harder you push, the harder the systems push back**

Compensating feedback is when well-intentioned interventions offset the benefits of the intervention.\(p. 58\) Senge provides an example of this when he writes:

> efforts to correct the U.S. trade imbalance by letting the  
>  value of the dollar fall in the mid-1980s were compensated for by  
>  foreign competitors who let prices of their goods fall in parallel \(for  
>  countries whose currency was "pegged to the dollar," their prices  
>  adjusted automatically\). \(p.59\)

In a similar fashion, the attempt to address homelessness in Canada created an industry requiring people to be homeless for them to survive as organizations. If homelessness is reduced or eliminated, hundreds of people in every province will be out of jobs as a result of solving homelessness. This in turn may create a whole new wave of homelessness as the unemployed caregivers become unable to pay their bills or meet their financial; obligations caused by the reduction or eradication of homelessness.

**Behavior grows better before it grows worse**

As in the illustration regarding solving homelessness, things do get better than worse; in the short term. But like a giant game of JENGA where pieces are stacked successfully, the organizational successes quickly erode or are replaced due to reorganization of funds. Soon enough of the original foundational idea is gone and the entire structure begins to topple, requiring other supports to prop it up. "The better before worse response to many management interventions

is what makes political decision making so counterproductive." \(Senge p. 60\)

**The easy way out usually leads back in**

"Pushing harder and harder on familiar solutions, while fundamental problems persist or worsen, is a reliable indicator of nonsystemic thinking." \(Senge, p. 61\) We need to look beyond the comfortable and familiar and push on into finding solutions in areas where we are unfamiliar, but might have an answer we had not considered previously.

**The cure can be worse than the disease**

"The long-term, most insidious consequence of applying nonsystemic  
 solutions is increased need for more and more of the solution." \(Senge, p. 61\)

The old saying about everything being a nail if you're a hammer applies here. Your solution becomes one size fits all. The solution becomes so predictable everyone in the organization makes it their go to whenever a challenge arises requiring attention. Senge suggests every truly healthy organization requires everyone to shoulder their own burdens, \(p. 62\) take responsibility for finding the best solutions for the challenges before them.  A sentiment repeated in Galatians 6:4, 5 in the Bible.

**4** Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else, **5 **for each one should carry their own load. \(Galatians 6: 4, 5 NIV\)

**Faster is slower**

> When  
>  growth becomes excessive ... the system itself will  
>  seek to compensate by slowing down; perhaps putting the  
>  organization's survival at risk in the process. \(Senge, p. 62\)

Taking the time in process, with well thought out answers to the organizational challenges experienced will help curtail excessive growth that can hinder the anticipated progress of the organization. We've seen many organizations experience growth and rapid success, only to fail shortly afterward because their success did not anticipate the effects growth would have on the organization as a whole.

Target Canada is a perfect example of the law of 'faster is slower.'  They entered the Canadian market after the highly successful growth and brand adoption in the US. The expansion was based primarily on the US growth success. As a result of poor planning, taking on too much too soon, poor supply chain issues to support their expansion, Target soon closed their doors in Canada less than two years after opening a massive number of stores to amazing fanfare. \(St. Louis, January 30, 2015\)

> The company assumed it could coast on its reputation, but its actions in the early stages of the expansion suggests it didn’t understand why Canadian customers loved Target’s U.S. stores.\(St. Louis, January 30, 2015\)

**Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space**

> Underlying all of the above problems is a fundamental characteristic of complex human systems: "cause" and "effect" are not close in time and space. By "effects," I mean the obvious symptoms that indicate that there are problems—drug abuse, unemployment, starving children, falling orders, and sagging profits. By "cause" I mean the interaction of the underlying system that is most responsible for generating the symptoms, and which, if recognized, could lead to changes producing lasting improvement. Why is this a problem? Because most of us assume they are—most of us assume, most of the time, that cause and effect are close in time and space. \(Senge, p. 63\)

What Senge is getting at is that cause and effect can occur between great distances of time and across great distances. The Butterfly Effect, made popular by movies, is part of the chaos theory. The chaos theory is part of

> a scientific field blending mathematics, statistics, and philosophy that was developed to study systems that are highly complex, unstable, and resistant to exact prediction. Chaotic systems include weather patterns, neural networks, some social systems, and a variety of chemical and quantum phenomena. The study of chaotic systems began in the nineteenth century and developed into a distinct field during the 1980s. \(Chaotic Systems, 2013\)

Small changes in initial conditions lead to drastic changes in results. \(Fractal Foundation\) What gets set in motion today, may not effect the organization for years to come. What started as a small imperfection in Europe can cost thousands of dollars in remanufacturing costs in North America. The key component to watching and monitoring cause and effect is diligence. Pay attention to the sources and results of all products and systems to determine their effect elsewhere.

**Small changes can produce large results—but the areas of highest leverage are often the least obvious.**

> Tackling a difficult problem is often a matter of seeing where the high leverage lies, a change which—with a minimum of effort—would lead to lasting, significant improvement. \(Senge. p. 64\)

Senge uses an illustration from Buckminster Fuller regarding the 'trim tab':

> The trim tab—this very small device that has an enormous effect on the huge ship—does the same for the rudder. When it is turned to one side or the other, it compresses the water flowing around the rudder and creates a small pressure differential that "sucks the rudder" in the desired direction. But, if you want the rudder to turn to the left, what direction do you turn the trim tab?—to the right, naturally.
>
> The entire system—the ship, the rudder, and the trim tab—is marvellously engineered through the principle of leverage. Yet, its functioning is totally nonobvious if you do not understand the force of hydrodynamics.
>
> So, too, are the high-leverage changes in human systems nonobvious until we understand the forces at play in those systems. \(Senge, p. 65\)

The bible speaks of another small high leverage device that creates high leverage changes; the tongue. Whether expressed directly or through written mediums like email or social media, the tongue can introduce small changes to personal or organizational perspectives that can affect/effect the entire outcome of corporate or personal relations; positively or negatively. \(James 3: 3-6\)

It is therefore important to realize, every word spoken or written, every plan made, every communication released and every explanation given, must be carefully reviewed before being released for public dissemination. - the smallest changes can produce large results; to the positive or negative.

**You can have your cake and eat it too  but not all at once**

American manufacturers thought they had to choose between low cost and high quality. "Higher quality products cost more to manufacture," they thought. "They take longer to assemble, require more expensive materials and components, and entail more extensive quality controls." What they didn't consider was all the ways the increasing quality and lowering costs could go hand in hand, over time. What they didn't consider was how basic 

improvements in work processes could eliminate rework, eliminate quality inspectors, reduce customer complaints, lower warranty costs, increase customer loyalty, and reduce advertising and sales promotion costs. They didn't realize that they could have both goals, if they were willing to wait for one while they focused on the other. Investing time and money to develop new skills and methods of assembly, including new methods for involving everyone responsible for improving quality, is an up front "cost." Quality and costs may both go up in the ensuing months; although some cost savings \(like reduced rework\) may be achieved fairly quickly, the full range of cost savings may take several years to harvest. \(Senge, p. 65\)
