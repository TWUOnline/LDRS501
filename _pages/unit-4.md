## Overview

### Week 3

This week introduces YOU to an understanding of Systems Thinking dynamics as it relates to Strategic Leadership. We will review three important concepts from the Systems Thinking realm and add more instruction around the PressBooks platform. The concepts we will review include:

* Senge's Laws for System Thinking. This section outlines Senge's work from his book, **_The Fifth Discipline_**, (2006).

* 5 additional laws to consider to expand our thinking on the topic.

* Organizational Learning Disabilities hindering the effective development and practice of Systems Thinking.

* More PressBooks instruction to prepare you further for the TEAM elements of the book preparation process.

Systems Thinking is an important part of Strategic Leadership development. Addressing healthy concepts, understanding the pitfalls associated with poor practice and assessing the ability or disability issues in Systems Thinking practice can improve your practice of Strategic Leadership principles and concepts.

The PressBooks material follows previous outlines for developing proficiency with the material. (add new information below with an overview here)

Assessing your present/previous team situation or course team environment **(see Hughes, et al., p. 213)**, did you/are you perform/performing effectively as a team to access all the diverse leadership perspectives? Why do you say so? Why not?

As you work with teams in your present/previous work environment and your team in this course, how do you build a sense of ownership and involvement?

What are some of the limiting factors in the team systems you’ve worked with or work with presently?

How do you identify bottlenecks in your present/previous team situation or course team environment? How do you address those issues without shutting down team creativity, efficiency or cohesiveness?

Using the Formal Groups section of Galbraith’s Designing Organizations text, identify the design choices in your present/previous working environment and compare it to the design choices you made for the function of your teams in this course?

* How are they similar?

* How are they different?

* What do you see needing improvement in both to make them more effective?

* How do YOU suggest building an effective Strategic Leadership team in your present environment based on your reading and present/previous team experiences?

* How will YOU deal with the struggles an SLT can face as it develops and takes on challenges in the working/course environments around you?
