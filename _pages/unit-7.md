(see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808)

SWOT Analysis and Brain storming processes are in declining use around the world (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&amp;list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v) , and its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to group think. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==CWEvJciU0Zc&amp;t=13s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AXOSQT5yVQ)

Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.

A newer process of Brain Swarming focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process included in Brain Swarming and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)

Brain swarming rejects gathering everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment not necessarily suitable for everyone. While Brain Storming is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, Brain Swarming asks:
Why do we need to talk in the first place?

How Brain Swarming works:

<ul>
    <li>Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.</li>
    <li>Inputs are sought from each team â€“ there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team</li>
    <li>Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)</li>
</ul>
