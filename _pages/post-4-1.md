This week I want to hear how the Strategic Leadership materials align with real time experience and practice. In essence, this is where your inner strategic consultant gets to engage the material. You know? The voice inside saying, _‘if I had the chance to make a difference in how we do things, I would…’_

Here is your chance.
Use strategy renewal, execution and organizational design principles (from assigned readings so far) as a focus:

**1. Outline the best steps you envision for developing performance best practices across all areas of the organization where you work/worked previously; addressing the various components of the organization like:**

a. Human resources (policies and procedures)

b. Corporate identity (public)

c. Organizational culture (internal)

**2. Identify some of the negative organizational renewal, execution and design challenges in the organization where you work/worked previously to address:**

a. The biggest impact these principles have/had on the organization where you work/worked previously. (If you work in an organization without any challenges, identify some potential areas you identify/identified in the organization you work/worked previously)

b. Three to five steps necessary to shift the negative impacts and help the organization where you work/worked previously refocus to reclaim organizational purpose, practise and procedures to a healthy level so they can move more effectively into the future.

**3. Three things you do (3+3+3 = 9 altogether):**

a. To promote the positive renewal, execution and organizational design principles in your career practice.

b. To promote the negative practice of these principles.

c. To correct behaviours not conducive to your career health and the principles required to promote healthy strategic practice.
