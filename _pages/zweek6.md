Our week starts with an opportunity to gather together in a video conference setting (similar to Week 1) and discuss progress so far, challenges, course related questions or simply to connect with one another. The next paragraphs relate to the sixth week of the course.  This week introduces you to TEAM BLOGging. You are not simply asked to take a topic and BLOG about it. In this BLOG you will represent a favourable or opposing view to a topic of discussion, with one TEAM member BLOGging to the other TEAMS in the class. YOU can follow the Link to BLOG 4 (Team Favour/Opposition BLOG) to interact with your fellow learners and your journey into TEAM BLOGging and response.

As in your other BLOGs, you are free to use all of the skills learned in the orientation to the WordPress process for making your BLOG come alive. Whether it is text alone, text and pictures, video, sound bite or a combination of all approaches. Make the your BLOG as unforgettable as possible. It is what people will remember about what you say and set you apart from one another as unique leaders in the field.

Following the BLOG  instructions, you will find a review of 6 Learning outcomes for the course, further BLOG and Assignment resource for TEAM Assignment 2.

Finally, the section outlines a Learning Activity for the week related to navigating the PressBooks environment.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Learning Activities in Weeks 6 through 10 relates specifically to navigating the PressBooks material so we can complete the Open Source Discoveries Book together.
