Looking at your area of personal worldview, responsibility, discipline, organization or area of study; respond to the questions below as they relate to critical thinking:

<ol>
<li>What are the changes influencing your personal worldview, area of responsibility, discipline, organization and/or area of study in the twenty- first century, and how can critical thinking help you respond to the changes affecting these areas of your life?</li>
<li>Look at each area; review the basic assumptions you are dealing with
<em>(i. e. the best way to travel across Canada is by bus)</em>
and list the changes influences these areas for you.</li>
<li>How can you think more critically about these changes?</li>
<li>List the critical observations you make on a separate log for future review and discussion.</li>
<li>Review these changes critically to broaden your personal worldview, area of responsibility, discipline, organization, area of study and practice?</li>
<li>Once you review these questions and respond to them:</li>
<li>Make a short proposal to yourself, your organization, people in your discipline or area of study to suggest changes to practices within these areas as the result of your critical review.</li>
<li>Keep the proposal for future use in other participation activities throughout the course.</li>
