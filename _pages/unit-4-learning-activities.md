#### Learning Activity 4. 1

This week

As you complete your reading of, _A Systems Thinking Primer: Seeing Organizations in Action_, (See Unit 4 Notes) reflect on the following questions to help you understand your System Thinking practice in the organization you presently serve or recently served. [Link to Unit 4 Notes]

1. How does your organization, or the organization you previously served, practice Senge's fundamentals (laws) for systems thinking?
a. What are some of the positive outcomes from practicing these fundamentals (laws)?
b. What are some of the negative outcomes from practicing these fundamentals (laws)?
c. What one change would you introduce to the practice of these fundamentals (laws) to improve what your organization, or the organization you previously served, accomplishes through their systems practice?
2. How does your organization, or the organization you previously served stack up to the additional 5 laws listed above?
a. Reflect on the impact these additional laws have on your organization, or the organization you previously served?
b. Which of these 5 listed additional laws are most evident in your organizational practice? What are their impact?
c. What organizational changes would you introduce to mitigate the effect of a departure from these 5 additional laws in your organization or the organization your served previously?
3. What organizational learning disabilities have you experienced in your career?
a. Have any of the organizations you worked with successfully navigated from disability to ability in their systemic practice?
i) What is the most memorable success story for that change?
b. If you had the opportunity to speak into your organization to change the evident disabilities, what would you say and what processes would you suggest to turn the corner from disability to ability?

As you complete these questions, you will have a better grasp on Systems Thinking practice and the development of Strategic Leadership principles going forward.
