### Unit 4 Learning Activities

#### Learning Activity 4. 1

As you complete your reading of, _A Systems Thinking Primer: Seeing Organizations in Action_ above, reflect on the following questions to help you understand your System Thinking practice in the organization you presently serve or recently served.

1. How does your organization, or the organization you previously served, practice Senge's fundamentals (laws) for systems thinking?
1. What are some of the positive outcomes from practicing these fundamentals (laws)?
2. What are some of the negative outcomes from practicing these fundamentals (laws)?
3. What one change would you introduce to the practice of these fundamentals (laws) to improve what your organization, or the organization you previously served, accomplishes through their systems practice?
2. How does your organization, or the organization you previously served stack up to the additional 5 laws listed above?
1. Reflect on the impact these additional laws have on your organization, or the organization you previously served?
2. Which of these 5 listed additional laws are most evident in your organizational practice? What are their impact?
3. What organizational changes would you introduce to mitigate the effect of a departure from these 5 additional laws in your organization or the organization your served previously?
3. What organizational learning disabilities have you experienced in your career?
1. Have any of the organizations you worked with successfully navigated from disability to ability in their systemic practice?
a) What is the most memorable success story for that change?
2. If you had the opportunity to speak into your organization to change the evident disabilities, what would you say and what processes would you suggest to turn the corner from disability to ability?

As you complete these questions, you will have a better grasp on Systems Thinking practice and the development of Strategic Leadership principles going forward.

<h4>TEAM Assignment 2 Resource Notes</h4>
The following resources will assist you in preparing for and completing TEAM Assignment 2
<h4><strong>SWOT</strong></h4>
SWOT analysis is a long standing strategic process used successfully by various and varying organizations for many years. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808)

SWOT Analysis and Brain storming processes are in declining use around the world (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v) , and its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to group think. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==CWEvJciU0Zc&t=13s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AXOSQT5yVQ)

Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.
<h4><strong>Brain Swarming</strong></h4>
A newer process of Brain Swarming focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process included in Brain Swarming and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)

Brain swarming rejects gathering everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment not necessarily suitable for everyone. While Brain Storming is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, Brain Swarming asks:
Why do we need to talk in the first place?

<strong>How Brain Swarming works:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.</li>
 	<li>Inputs are sought from each team – there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team</li>
 	<li>Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)</li>
</ul>
