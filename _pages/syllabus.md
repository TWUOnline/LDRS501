<strong>Academic Integrity and Avoiding Plagiarism at TWU</strong>

As scholars pursuing higher education, academic integrity is a core value of the entire TWU community. Students are invited into this scholarly culture and required to abide by the principles of sound academic scholarship at TWU. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and cheating in scholarly work. TWU has a strict policy on plagiarism (see academic calendar). Learning what constitutes plagiarism and avoiding it is the student's responsibility. Two resources describing plagiarism and how to avoid it have been prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke and are freely available for viewing at the URLs below:

<strong>ATTENDANCE POLICY</strong>

All students are expected to provide substantive input into all Assignments and Discussion Questions throughout the course. Failing to provide substantive input into the course work and team participation exercises may result in reduced grading.

<strong>FINAL EXAMINATIONS</strong>

There are no final examinations for this course. Grading is assigned through the culmination of Assignments and discussion questions as listed in the “COURSE ACTIVITIES/PROPOSED OUTLINE/DETERMINATION OF FINAL SEMESTER GRADE” listed above.

<strong>GRADING SYSTEM</strong>

In an effort to ensure consistency in the MA Lead/MAEL assignment of grades and to inform graduate students of assessments of the quality of work at the graduate level, the following interpretation of grades in assignments and courses offers a guideline.

<strong>Letter Grade:</strong> A+

<strong>%:</strong> 95-100

<strong>Grade Point:</strong> 4.3

<strong>Value Meaning in Graduate Work:</strong>

Exceptionally well-reasoned, compelling development of position. Outstanding incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Strikingly appropriate examples. Extraordinary insight, critical analytical and evaluative ability, and creativity. Superlative style and language usage. Makes an original contribution and is potentially publishable.

<strong>Note:</strong> For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade.

<strong>Letter Grade:</strong> A

<strong>%:</strong> 90-94

<strong>Grade Point:</strong> 4.0

<strong>Value Meaning in Graduate Work:</strong>

Well-argued and convincing development of position. Insightful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Notably appropriate examples. Excellent insight, critical analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Impressive style and language use.

<strong>Note:</strong> For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade.

<strong>Letter Grade:</strong> A-

<strong>%:</strong> 85-89

<strong>Grade Point:</strong> 3.7

<strong>Value Meaning in Graduate Work:</strong>

<strong>Grade Point:</strong> 3.3

<strong>Value Meaning in Graduate Work:</strong>

Reasonable insight, analytic and evaluative ability. Little creativity. Generally satisfactory style and language usage, but possibly with some minor flaws.

<strong>Note:</strong> For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade.

<strong>Letter Grade:</strong> B-

<strong>%:</strong> 70-74

<strong>Grade Point:</strong> 2.7*

<strong>Value Meaning in Graduate Work:</strong>

Unimpressive development of position. Position not completely consistent with personal vision or references and resources not taken fully into account or examples are basic or not completely convincing or lacking acceptable insight and analytic and evaluative ability. Style and language usage with weaknesses <em>(e.g., clarity, coherence, grammar)</em>. Overall quality shows noticeable deficiencies.

<strong>Note:</strong> For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade.

<strong>Letter Grade:</strong> F

<strong>%:</strong> &lt;70

<strong>Grade Point:</strong> 2.0

<strong>Value Meaning in Graduate Work:</strong>

Unacceptable work at graduate level. Shows lack of understanding and/or competence in several of the criteria described above. This grade is a failing grade at the graduate level, and students receiving a “C” course grade are required to re-take the course.

<strong>Note:</strong> For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade.
<p style="text-align: center">Note: * a grade of “B-“carries a GPA of 2.7. Learners require a composite GPA of 3.0 to graduate.</p>
<strong>Other Designated Grades</strong>

<strong>INC = Incomplete.</strong> A grade may be incomplete if assignments remain outstanding in a course or if the instructor has not yet submitted a grade. If assignments remain outstanding at the end of a course, students must obtain and complete an incomplete grade form from Enrolment Services.

<strong>W = Withdrew.</strong> This grade is assigned for students withdrawing during the first half of the course.

<strong>WP/WF = Withdrew passing/Withdrew failing.</strong> These grades are assigned to students withdrawing during the second half of a course. Grades are not computed into the cumulative GPA. A student may withdraw from a course only because of severe extenuating circumstances and if approval is granted by the Program Director and the Dean of Graduate Studies.

<strong>LATE ASSIGNMENTS POLICY</strong>

Assignments are due by midnight Pacific Time (PDT/PST) in the appropriate assignment folder in the online classroom on the day they are due (preferably as Word documents). Once I grade your assignment, I will put it in your grade book in the online classroom where you can check your grade and review the comments made on the assignment. There is a 10% deduction per day an assignment is late. The only exception is an approved extension confirmed at least 5 days prior to the assignment due date. Extensions are granted on a case by case basis and without penalty. There will be no extensions on Discussion Question due dates. Rewritten/Resubmitted assignments, will receive a 20% of the assignment’s value before assigning a grade to the rewritten assignment

Students should follow the steps detailed by the Equity of Access Office outlined in the Student Life section of [the 2009-10 Academic] Calendar." P.40, 2009-10 Academic Calendar.
