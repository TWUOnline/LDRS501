<h3>Learning Activity 4.3</h3>

<h4>Organizational <strong>Information </strong>Strategies</h4>

Once you understand the various thinking models and habits of your teams, there is the development of effective communication strategies to assist in communicating to the diverse thinking styles represented by the teams within the organizational framework; from the Board and Executive Leadership, on through the grassroots members of your most ad hoc teams. Clear communication of strategic goals and plans is imperative for the success of any organization wanting to fulfill its strategic imperatives.

<blockquote>... the greater the uncertainty of the task, the greater the amount of information that has to be processed between decision makers during the execution of the task. (Galbraith, p. 28)</blockquote>

Jay Galbraith, as early as 1974, identified the importance of informational strategies across organizations to ensure the message did not get lost in the diversity of the teams represented within the organizational framework. He outlines the following information strategies for organizations, still effective for use in today's rapidly changing and strongly challenging strategy driven corporate environments. His suggestions include:

<ol>
    <li><strong>Increasing the ability of teams to preplan before going forward.</strong> Allowing teams the ability to preplan provides the opportunity to assign various and varying team members to tasks they are best suited to participate in. Taking into consideration their strengths, weaknesses, thinking styles and schedules for completion, can allow a team to be the most effective with the tools at hand.</li>
    <li><strong>Increase their flexibility to adapt to their inability to preplan</strong> by providing more explanation and investigation time to put it all together. Taking into account the various thinking styles, addressing bias and allowing issues of distrust to be explored and responded to can help remove barriers to preplanning by responding to concerns or challenges within the corporate environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Work with what you've got</strong>, not what you wish you had. "Decrease the level of performance required for continued viability." (p. 28) We all want a dream team, but the reality is most organizations simply have great teams that can work phenomenally at a level of equality focused on moving the goals forward and accomplishing the tasks within their ability levels and understanding of the goals. Communicating clear goals to a team you have confidence in, versus adding the undue pressure of heightened expectations they may not be able to achieve within the time frames assigned will allow everyone and every goal to have the best opportunity for fulfillment and support of the strategies enlisted for successful organizational growth.</li>
</ol>

To accomplish these goals, Galbraith suggests using a mechanistic model to address the nuances representative of complex teams, whether due to numbers of teams and component member parts or thinking styles, biases, distrust issues or other variables arising in the process. He suggests 'integrating mechanisms which increase its information processing capabilities.' (p. 29)

<ol>
    <li><strong>Coordination by Rules or Programs.</strong> Rules or programs coordinate behaviour between interdependent groups and responsibilities within teams and organizational structures. Each role executes the appropriate decision or behaviour appropriate to the assigned task or responsibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Hierarchy.</strong> As the organization faces situations where no rules are set for the situation, good hierarchy can provide direction and focus to the teams to allay any uncertainties or a stoppage in momentum. Used sparingly and only as necessary, this can be a useful tool in assisting the forward momentum of strategic goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Coordination by Targets or Goals.</strong> As uncertainty increases, coordination must also increasing to specify goals and targets related to the various team responsibilities within the strategic process. The organization highlights processes to help teams achieve goals to allow employees to select behaviours conducive to accomplishing the intended organizational goals.</li>
</ol>

Regardless of your process, you do need one, it must take into account the nuances in thinking, the relationships with and within the organization and understand the levels of ability the teams have in meeting goals and making strategic initiatives successful. Leaders must provide leadership to allow leaders within the organization to lead. Taking shortcuts, placing expectations too high or simply leaving outcomes to chance are not options leaders can afford when dealing with the future and health of the organizations they serve.

<u>Choice and Feelings</u>

<strong>Values, beliefs, traditions and symbols</strong>

As we move to how values beliefs and symbols affect/effect strategy and the success of strategic goals within an organization, we need to be aware of how we view values on various topics. For this exercise, look at the exercise below. It asks you to sort, by importance to you, the educational values you think should be emphasized in public schools. The evaluation asks:
