### Assignment 3

#### **WEEK 7 – TEAM ASSIGNMENT 2**

#### **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP TEAM PROJECT (15%)**

##### **STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS – Sustain, Delete, Rethink and Add-Innovate**

##### **Team submissions Due Day 7 of Week 7 at 23:59 PST**

This assignment is intended as an applied learning experience using SWOT in conjunction with either a _**‘brain storming’**_ process or the newer approach of **‘brain swarming’** to develop your information.

SWOT analysis is a long standing strategic process used successfully by various and varying organizations for many years.

SWOT Analysis however, is in declining use as are **Brain storming** processes.

Its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to **group think**.

Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.

A newer process of ** Brain Swarming ** focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process included in ** Brain Swarming ** and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking.

Brain swarming rejects gathering everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment not necessarily suitable for everyone. While **Brain Storming** is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, **Brain Swarming** asks:

**Why do we need to talk in the first place?**

##### How brain swarming works:

* Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.
* Inputs are sought from each team – there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team
* Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. (see
