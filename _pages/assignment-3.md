<h3>Assignment 3</h3>

<h4><strong>WEEK 7 – TEAM ASSIGNMENT 2</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP TEAM PROJECT (15%)</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS – Sustain, Delete, Rethink and Add-Innovate</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>Team submissions Due Sunday June 17 at 23:59 PST</strong></h5>

This assignment is intended as an applied learning experience using SWOT in conjunction with either a <em><strong>‘brain storming’</strong></em> process or the newer approach of <strong>‘brain swarming’</strong> to develop your information.

SWOT analysis is a long standing strategic process used successfully by various and varying organizations for many years. (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808</a>)

SWOT Analysis however, is in declining use as are <strong>Brain storming</strong> processes (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&amp;list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&amp;list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v</a>) , and its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to <strong>group think</strong>. (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMKK17EWXks">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMKK17EWXks</a>)

Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.

A newer process of ** Brain Swarming ** focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process included in ** Brain Swarming ** and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking. (see <a href="https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work">https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work</a>)

Brain swarming rejects gathering everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment not necessarily suitable for everyone. While <strong>Brain Storming</strong> is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, <strong>Brain Swarming</strong> asks:

<strong>Why do we need to talk in the first place?</strong>

<h5>How brain swarming works:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.</li>
<li>Inputs are sought from each team – there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team</li>
<li>Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. (see <a href="https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work">https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work</a>)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Assignment Parameters</strong>

Using Lepsinger's 6 Bridge Building Principles in "Closing the Execution Gap (2010) and Hughes, Beatty and Dunwoody's assessment tools for assessing organizational capacity for change in Becoming a Strategic Leader (2014) from Exhibits 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 (pp. 130-133) and the AAR six step process outlined on p. 134;
