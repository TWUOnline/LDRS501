<h4>Other Designated Grades</h4>
<strong>INC = Incomplete</strong> - A grade may be incomplete if assignments remain outstanding in a course or if the instructor has not submitted a grade. If assignments remain outstanding at the end of a course, students must obtain and complete an incomplete grade form from Enrollment Services.

<strong>W = Withdrew</strong> - This grade is assigned for students withdrawing during the first half of the course.

<strong>WP/WF</strong> <strong>= Withdrew passing / Withdrew failing</strong> - These grades are assigned to students withdrawing during the second half of a course. Grades are not computed into the cumulative GPA. A student may withdraw from a course only because of <span style="text-decoration: underline">severe</span> extenuating circumstances and only if approval is granted by the Program Director and Dean of Graduate Studies.
