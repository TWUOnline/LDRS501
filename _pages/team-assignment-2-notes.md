#### Team Assignment 2 Resource Notes

The following resources will assist you in preparing for and completing team Assignment 2

#### **SWOT**

SWOT analysis is a long standing strategic process used successfully by various and varying organizations for many years. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808) SWOT Analysis and Brain storming processes are in declining use around the world (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v) , and its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to group think (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==CWEvJciU0Zc&t=13s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AXOSQT5yVQ). Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.

#### **Brain Swarming**

A newer process of Brain Swarming focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process included in Brain Swarming and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work). Brain swarming rejects gathering everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment not necessarily suitable for everyone. While Brain Storming is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, Brain Swarming asks: Why do we need to talk in the first place? 

**How Brain Swarming works:**

*   Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.
*   Inputs are sought from each team â€“ there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team
*   Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)
