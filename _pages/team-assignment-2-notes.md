<h4>Team Assignment 2 Resource Notes</h4>

The following resources will assist you in preparing for and completing team Assignment 2

<h4><strong>SWOT</strong></h4>

SWOT analysis is a long standing strategic process used successfully by various and varying organizations for many years. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808) SWOT Analysis and Brain storming processes are in declining use around the world (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&amp;list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v) , and its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to group think. (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==CWEvJciU0Zc&amp;t=13s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AXOSQT5yVQ) Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.

<h4><strong>Brain Swarming</strong></h4>

A newer process of Brain Swarming focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process included in Brain Swarming and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work) Brain swarming rejects gathering everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment not necessarily suitable for everyone. While Brain Storming is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, Brain Swarming asks: Why do we need to talk in the first place? <strong>How Brain Swarming works:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.</li>
<li>Inputs are sought from each team – there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team</li>
<li>Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. (see https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)</li>
</ul>
