This is the week where you can focus your energies on completing your Final Assignment and submit your material for insertion into the PressBooks environment as you complete the work on the Strategic Discoveries open source book project.

This section reviews the Assignment parameters for the Final Team Assignment due in Week 10 and a Learning Activity related to the PressBooks materials. This PressBook material is mostly for review, but can be helpful as you finalize your team assignments for LDRS 501OL.
