### Pre-reading and introductory Learning Activities

This section of study will provide you with a foundational overview on the general texts for the course, the outcomes we will focus on for the beginning stages of course pre-reading and introductory Learning Activities. The Foundational Learning Activities for this section will introduce you to the concepts of Personal Learning and Leadership and Critical Thinking. Once you work through these activities you will have a greater grasp on the concepts presented and be prepared for the coursework ahead.

In this overview you will find some important items for your review and attention as you begin navigating through LDRS 501OL.

The first item you will notice is the reading overview is the allowance for each participant to proceed through the texts related to this course with a focused schedule to allow each person to have opportunity to progress through the material before the course begins. Each section represents the time it will take to read through the material in 4 weeks.

Next you will notice a section entitled Outcomes. This section outlines what the course aims to accomplish and what we aim to help you accomplish through the work and learning for this course. This requires and intentionality on the part of the instructor and the learner to both observe, track and respond to the course activities (graded and ungraded) to help them achieve these outcomes throughout the coursework and the completion of the material therein.

Finally, you will see directions to learning Activities specifically focused for this unit. Each unit will have learning activities attached and will all help you develop the competencies and understanding associated with the practice of progressive strategic leadership habits. In this group of learning activities, you will find Learning Activities related to Personal Learning and Leadership, Critical Thinking and the development of skill specifically focused on the  development and entry of the PressBooks materials we will use for publishing our open source book on Strategic Leadership Discoveries.

One final note. If you do not have access to these items prior to the start of the course, no worries. You can work through these concepts over the first weeks of the course to assist your developmental understanding of later concepts introduced to your strategic leadership tool kit.
