<h3>Week 4 Learning Activity 4.2 Instruction and Questions</h3>
Read the learning notes below for Week 4 of the course. Once you read the materials below complete the activity(ies) that follow. Follow the instructions for the learning activity to gain understanding and interact with the related material for greater understanding of the Week 4 Strategic Leadership principles outlined.
<h3>Learning Activity 4.2</h3>
<h4><strong>Subjectivity and Intuition</strong></h4>
In addition to the learning styles and approaches mentioned in Lesson 4.1, there are more complex styles to consider. For example, learning can be subjective or intuitive.

Subjective thinking has no objective standard guiding it and is subject to the interpretation of the individual with no objective reference to prove the thinking is logical or objective in nature. Thinking based on emotion and personal preference rather than rational logic. (http://complexitylabs.io/subjective-thinking/) To put it bluntly, the reasoning is all in their head. (JIBC, p. 1)

There is a place for subjective thinking. It is generally in the realm of books, movies, video games and art, where the subjective interpretation of the material under review affects/effects the speaker and reflects their preferences. When there is a need for a balanced view in making decisions and move teams toward strategic goals, objectivity is preferred.

For the subjective thinker, leaders need to ask questions regarding the objectivity of what is shared. Is there an objective proof behind what is said, or why they believe what they say they believe. A strong subjective thinker can derail teams with very little effort, for what they lack in objective reasoning they more than make up in passion.

According to Higson and Sturgess (2018), 'approaches to decision making can be quite diverse, ranging from classical, rationalistic, decision making processes to a less structured, intuitive, decision making style.' Additionally, they note:

'Rational decision making processes consist of a sequence of steps designed to rationally develop a desired solution. Intuitive decision making is almost the opposite, being more instinctive, subjective and subconscious in nature.' (the-happy-manager.com)

They continue to make the point that knowing which type of decision making is essential for effective decision making is an important part of the team development process. They state however, the importance of knowing how and when to combine rational and intuitive approaches as an essential part of leading strategically. (the-happy-manager.com) The central focus for all leaders is to know when to listen and when to decide on objective support for ideas over subjective intuition.

The key action for the leader facing subjective or intuitive thinkers is listening. Listen, weigh the options and decide based on the best evidence. Your subjective and intuitive thinkers may just surprise everyone.

No discussion on thinking and learning strategically is complete without a discussion on inevitable bias and communication distrust.
<h4>Inevitable Bias</h4>
We all live with some form of bias in any given situation. An inevitable bias leads toward inevitable outcomes based on predetermined bias, whether conscious or unconscious, in foresight or hindsight. The bias shapes the outcome, except it may not be planned as bias, simply unfolds as bias because of the opinions held by the person(s) investigating the facts or evidence set before them.

Psychological bias leads people to downplay the probability and danger of change, and their role in it, while increasing their perceived incentives to maintain the status quo, and to blame problems on others. (Johnson and Levin, p. 1593)

To determine how inevitable bias affects your perceptions and thinking take the Implicit Association test (IAT) @ https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/canada/. There are a variety of choices for you to make to test your biases toward a variety of topics. There is no expectation for you to share the results of the IAT, but only ex[pose you to possible biases you might hold and allow you to assess your own thinking in this regard.
<h4>Communication Distrust</h4>
Communication distrust rarely shows itself aggressively in a work environment. As Glenn Llopis outlines in his January 2011 Forbes Leadership article entitled <em>'How distrust, indifference and lack of integrity will destroy your business,' </em>
<blockquote>Distrust will not show itself in obvious fashion because distrust knows it is not welcome. It will hide and only become visible to those with the skill to see beneath the obvious. The ability to spot the weed of distrust is not simple, but all weeds of this nature look alike. (Llopis)</blockquote>
Communication distrust lies below the surface and only rears its head when it feels safe to do so and cause the greatest damage to organizational or relationship structures. Distrust plants its own seeds through every interaction. The only way to combat it is to act in the best interests of all concerned and create trusting environments through open dialogue and transparency throughout.
