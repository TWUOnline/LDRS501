Welcome to Week 7!

The outline for Week 7 links to the materials you need to review, develop and learn about Strategic Leadership.

Our week starts with an opportunity to consider the topic of Conflict and Cooperation in our Blog Forum and a return to individual blogging, in addition to the completion of team Assignment 2.

Following the blogÂ  instructions, you will find further review of 6 Learning outcomes, Blog and Assignment direction for completion of team Assignment 2.

Finally, the section outlines a Learning Activity for the week related to navigating the PressBooks environment.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Learning Activities in Weeks 7 through 10 relate specifically to working in PressBooks so we can complete the Open Source Discoveries Book together.

All activities, assignments and readings for this unit are expected for completion and/or due on Week 7 - Day 7.
