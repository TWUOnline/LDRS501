<!--themify_builder_static--><h1>Reading Week<br/>Unit 5</h1>
 <p>This is the Reading Week for this course and represents your opportunity to catch up on reading, assignments, PressBooks materials and take a break from posting blog materials. I have listed a few <em>optional</em> reading items and some review to help you understand Strategic Leadership concepts better. I also included a <em>video</em> featuring <a href="http://(https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZrTl16hZdk)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Rumelt</a>, a renowned scholar on strategy concepts, for your viewing. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZrTl16hZdk) The <em>video</em> runs about 1 hour and 34 minutes, but has many insights you might enjoy as you traverse the wilds of Strategic Leadership.</p><p>If you want to make an appointment with me during this week to discuss anything related to your course work or progression, please feel free to connect with me and we will make a time to get together, in person, or via Skype, ZOOM or phone.</p><p>Enjoy your reading week.</p>
