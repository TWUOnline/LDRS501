<h4><strong>Subjectivity and Intuition</strong></h4>
<h4>Reflective Questions and Activity.</h4>
To determine the climate you live in, look beneath the details of your company meetings. Personally assess your environment using the following scale suggested by Llopis.
<ul>
 	<li>What political undercurrents exist? Trust      Distrust   Why do you say that? What evidence do you have?</li>
 	<li>Do your leaders merely make expected power plays, puffing themselves up and blowing smoke to cover up the truth? Yes   No   Why do you say that? What evidence do you have?</li>
 	<li>Can the leaders be trusted and do they trust the workers? Yes   No   Why do you say that? What evidence do you have?</li>
 	<li>Are the discussion topics in the meeting subjective, vague, and seasoned with optimism? Yes   No   Why do you say that? What evidence do you have?</li>
 	<li>Are the discussion topics in the meeting objective and supported by observations from the workplace? Yes   No   Why do you say that? What evidence do you have?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Organizational <strong>Information </strong>Strategies</h4>
<strong>Educational Values Exercise<i></i><u></u></strong>

Using the Q-Sort Sheet below, rank the following educational values according to what you think should be emphasized in public schools.
<ol>
 	<li>competing with others</li>
 	<li>Fostering creativity</li>
 	<li>Developing intellectual potential</li>
 	<li>Cooperating through teamwork</li>
 	<li>Stressing individual development</li>
 	<li>Developing positive social relationships</li>
 	<li>Ensuring a well-organized, orderly environment</li>
 	<li>Developing student emotional stability</li>
 	<li>Preparing career skills</li>
</ol>
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-295" src="http://create.twu.ca/ldrs501-su18/files/2018/03/Educational-Values-Exercise_edited-2-300x244.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="244" />

To make it interesting, ask three friends, family members, coworkers, or for the adventurous, three strangers to complete the exercise, then compare responses.
<ol>
 	<li>What is the same?</li>
 	<li>What's different?</li>
 	<li>Where do you agree?</li>
 	<li>Where do you differ?</li>
 	<li>What do the results tell you about the people who filled out the form?</li>
 	<li>What are their values?</li>
 	<li>What is their view on education?</li>
 	<li>Any other question you want to analyze from the data.</li>
</ol>
Regardless of the outcome. the exercise can tell you a lot about what you value and what the people around you value. The differences are not areas of dissension, simply areas of awareness. People who do not hold your specific values exist. They are within your scope of friendships, family and acquaintance. How does that affect the way you proceeded on issues where values differ?

<strong>The Q sort sheet</strong> can be applied to a wide variety of issues and provides an informal snapshot for  a variety of issues you may face in your day to day operations in almost any organization; big or small.

<strong>Best practice questions</strong>

&nbsp;

Once you review the Top 10 Best Practices ask the following questions about your present work team with your organization or an organization you previously worked with.
<ol>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Does our team seek diversity in putting together our planning teams? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Are our strategic planning teams firefighters or skydivers? Yes      No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Is our team a lone ranger hierarchy where one person does all the work and everyone else waits until they are told what to do? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Is our team a collaborative visionary team where everyone pulls together to see the plans fulfilled?  Yes    No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Our Senior Leadership runs all the planning meetings with little input from others around the table. Yes   No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Does the team understand how the plan unfolds and what execution steps are required for success? Yes  No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Do we have a third party facilitator to help us through the process? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>was the plan actionable? Did the plan clearly articulate goals, action steps, responsibilities, accountability, and specific deadlines, and did everyone understand the plan and their role in it? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Is there pressure to meet our strategic targets exactly as stated without flexible wiggle room for adjustments to the process? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Did you know the next steps of your plan before you were expected to implement them? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Did you review your strategic plan regularly? (weekly, monthly, quarterly) Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
Once you answer the questions above, review them once more and list what actions you believe could change the process and make them into a list of recommendations you could present to your present leadership or the leadership of the organization you recently worked for.
