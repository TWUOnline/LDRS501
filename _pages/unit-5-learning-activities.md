<h4><strong>Subjectivity and Intuition</strong></h4>
<h4>Reflective Questions and Activity.</h4>
To determine the climate you live in, look beneath the details of your company meetings. Personally assess your environment using the following scale suggested by Llopis.
<ul>
 	<li>What political undercurrents exist? Trust      Distrust   Why do you say that? What evidence do you have?</li>
 	<li>Do your leaders merely make expected power plays, puffing themselves up and blowing smoke to cover up the truth? Yes   No   Why do you say that? What evidence do you have?</li>
 	<li>Can the leaders be trusted and do they trust the workers? Yes   No   Why do you say that? What evidence do you have?</li>
 	<li>Are the discussion topics in the meeting subjective, vague, and seasoned with optimism? Yes   No   Why do you say that? What evidence do you have?</li>
 	<li>Are the discussion topics in the meeting objective and supported by observations from the workplace? Yes   No   Why do you say that? What evidence do you have?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Organizational <strong>Information </strong>Strategies</h4>
<strong>Educational Values Exercise<i></i><u></u></strong>

Using the Q-Sort Sheet below, rank the following educational values according to what you think should be emphasized in public schools.
<ol>
 	<li>competing with others</li>
 	<li>Fostering creativity</li>
 	<li>Developing intellectual potential</li>
 	<li>Cooperating through teamwork</li>
 	<li>Stressing individual development</li>
 	<li>Developing positive social relationships</li>
 	<li>Ensuring a well-organized, orderly environment</li>
 	<li>Developing student emotional stability</li>
 	<li>Preparing career skills</li>
</ol>
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-295" src="http://create.twu.ca/ldrs501-su18/files/2018/03/Educational-Values-Exercise_edited-2-300x244.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="244" />

To make it interesting, ask three friends, family members, coworkers, or for the adventurous, three strangers to complete the exercise, then compare responses.
<ol>
 	<li>What is the same?</li>
 	<li>What's different?</li>
 	<li>Where do you agree?</li>
 	<li>Where do you differ?</li>
 	<li>What do the results tell you about the people who filled out the form?</li>
 	<li>What are their values?</li>
 	<li>What is their view on education?</li>
 	<li>Any other question you want to analyze from the data.</li>
</ol>
Regardless of the outcome. the exercise can tell you a lot about what you value and what the people around you value. The differences are not areas of dissension, simply areas of awareness. People who do not hold your specific values exist. They are within your scope of friendships, family and acquaintance. How does that affect the way you proceeded on issues where values differ?

<strong>The Q sort sheet</strong> can be applied to a wide variety of issues and provides an informal snapshot for  a variety of issues you may face in your day to day operations in almost any organization; big or small.

<h4>Learning Activity 5.4</h4>
<strong>Issues, Leaders, Approaches, and Questions </strong>

<strong>Uncertainty and Change</strong>

Regardless the choices you make in any strategic approach you face uncertainty and change. Nothing is solid gold, unalterable or guaranteed. Working with people requires you to determine risk over reward. Measuring the cost of investment over return; every time. In the equation uncertainty will be a factor. Change will be a force to assess and adjust to through the process.

If you want to engage strategically without uncertainty and change, then play video games. The outcome does not affect the lives of the people in your organization and any changes you don't like can be offset by turning the power off. Strategic planning and implementation requires risk. Strategic planning and implementation results in change. The challenge is using the resources around you to ensure both uncertainty and change are positive outcomes of the effort and energy expended.

<strong>Strategic issue levels</strong>

In the context of a Strengths, Weaknesses. Opportunities and Threat Analysis (SWOT), Opportunities and Threats represent the strategic issues facing the organization. Strengths and Weaknesses identify observable conclusions by the organization, whereas opportunities and threats identify the strategies related to addressing the realities this represents.

Strategic issue levels related to Opportunities, outline how the organization will strategically address the opportunities they see and capitalize on them to maximize the opportunities presented. The strategies coming from this discussion and developed by various organizational teams, provides the framework and the strategic issue levels the organization will address.

One of the simpler approaches is to take your established SWOT and break off into teams to review the strategic issues represented in your identified opportunities and threats. The process below describes an option for addressing strategic issues.
<ol>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Place the list of Opportunities and Threats in front of you.</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Review each opportunity and each threat. List them one by one under each heading.</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Describe each opportunity and each threat in detail as it relates to the organization's future. Write down a summary for each.</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Ask the team what the best possible outcome is for each opportunity and each threat. Write it down.</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Ask the team what could possibly go wrong in the opportunity and threat strategies listed. Discuss and make a summary of your discussion.</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote> Review the opportunities and threats again.</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Ask the team what your team will do if the strategic process fails in solving issues related to the opportunities and threat strategies.</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Make plans to address the issues you foresee.</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>If the plans do not address the issue, start at number 1 and repeat until the strategic issues are resolved and addressed.</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<strong>Evaluating strategic plans</strong>

William R. King (1978) in his thorough observation of strategic plans outlines several important facets for evaluating strategic planning activities. He suggests:
<ol>
 	<li>Any strategic planning requires attention to the organizational mission.</li>
 	<li>It must stay true to the organization's strategic directives <em>(chosen organizational direction to achieve its goals)</em>.</li>
 	<li>Take into account miscellaneous categories of engagement that may not be outlined in the main mission and organizational strategic objectives <em>(taking a fluid look at all issues affecting planning)</em>.</li>
</ol>
He goes on to outline how to evaluate system objectives in the evaluation process to determine the specific focus for the organization and define objectives in more concise and clearer language. (p. 30) He also takes a clear view toward systemic constraints and design strategies, to assist in the development and progression of the strategic plan and design. (pp. 30, 31) Outlining important evaluative processes to ensure the strategic planning organizations engage provides the best result possible for the organization and the future strategic plans it envisions.

While King's article does not deal with every eventuality effectively, it does 'provide a basis for explicating individual systems in a fashion which facilitates choice and priority setting.' (p. 37) The message overall however, is the importance to evaluate strategic plans before, during and after implementation to ensure the trajectory of the plan, the pathway taken and the outcomes align with organizational objectives and to better ensure the success of the strategic plans envisioned, enacted and engaged.
<h4>Reflective Questions and Activity.</h4>
<strong>Evaluate</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>What about your organizational strategic plans?</li>
 	<li>Does your organization have a process of evaluation to ensure the plan is effective? Momentum is established and maintained? the objectives remain intact after the plan begins? Why do you say so? Why not?</li>
 	<li>Review your most recent strategic plan and evaluate its overall effectiveness using the few questions cited above.</li>
 	<li>What was your outcome?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Learning Activity 5.5</h4>
<strong>Best practice questions</strong>

Kim Perkins, Client Engagement Manager for OnStrategy, lists a good best practices list for strategic planning initiatives. OnStrategy is a strategic planning consulting organization who 'believe strategic planning is more than simply achieving business goals. It creates confidence in the future.' (https://onstrategyhq.com/about-us/)

Follow the link (https://onstrategyhq.com/resources/the-top-10-strategic-planning-best-practices/) to review Perkins <em>Top 10 Strategic Planning Best Practices</em>.

Once you review the Top 10 Best Practices ask the following questions about your present work team with your organization or an organization you previously worked with.
<ol>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Does our team seek diversity in putting together our planning teams? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Are our strategic planning teams firefighters or skydivers? Yes      No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Is our team a lone ranger hierarchy where one person does all the work and everyone else waits until they are told what to do? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Is our team a collaborative visionary team where everyone pulls together to see the plans fulfilled?  Yes    No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Our Senior Leadership runs all the planning meetings with little input from others around the table. Yes   No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Does the team understand how the plan unfolds and what execution steps are required for success? Yes  No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Do we have a third party facilitator to help us through the process? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>was the plan actionable? Did the plan clearly articulate goals, action steps, responsibilities, accountability, and specific deadlines, and did everyone understand the plan and their role in it? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Is there pressure to meet our strategic targets exactly as stated without flexible wiggle room for adjustments to the process? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Did you know the next steps of your plan before you were expected to implement them? Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>
<blockquote>Did you review your strategic plan regularly? (weekly, monthly, quarterly) Yes     No</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
Once you answer the questions above, review them once more and list what actions you believe could change the process and make them into a list of recommendations you could present to your present leadership or the leadership of the organization you recently worked for.

<strong>Strategic IQ</strong>
<blockquote>'Strategic intelligence is the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances, as opposed to blindly continuing on a path when all the signals in your competitive environment suggest you need to change course.' - John R. Wells</blockquote>
Wells, in an interview with Michael Blanding (2012), suggests Strategic IQ is established in an organization when 'the people in a company are intrinsically motivated to develop and execute good strategy.'

Wells outlines ways of developing Strategic IQ, as well as critical success factors required for companies to excel in their strategies. The first, and in many instances the most important critical success factor, is 'the capacity to tolerate and learn from failure.' (Dalkir, 2016) The second critical success factor is 'the need to constantly adapt to the changing competitive environment.' (Dalkir)

For the one, it's all about learning through our success and failure in the process and gleaning lessons form both. Not gloating over what we've accomplished to the detriment of others. Not punishing failure as if it is not allowed in the process. Both bring learning and both bring wisdom and both add to our strategic IQ as we increase our knowledge over time and through the various and varying circumstances we face. (Dalkir)

For the second, it means understanding and learning what's happening around us. Predicting and facing the challenges as they come. Forecasting situations that unfold in the process to help with decision-making. Analyzing the past to inform the future to prevent the repeat of past errors. (Dalkir)

Increasing Strategic IQ ensures 'accurate and valid means of assessing your success.' (Dalkir) By evaluating returns on investments (ROI), benefits can be measured 'from strategic and business intelligence processes as well as technologies.' (Dalkir) You also need to 'need to assess the value and effectiveness of organizational learning processes. ' (Dalkir) Taking into consideration the need for regular review of strategic processes to ensure an even and consistent forward progression at a level consistent with progress and never satisfied with settling for what you get, but pushing forward to the best possible outcomes the strategies devised and implemented will bring the organization.

<strong>Other Strategy Research</strong>

One final resource to recommend for  researching strategies for a variety of organizations is a resource found in our own library. The book by Baum and Lampel outlines a variety of strategy research to give you a well rounded understanding of the diversity represented in researching various strategies around the world. This is a small volume by comparison and is only mentioned for your benefit, should you choose to follow through with reading the material. It is not required for the course.
