Your final assignment will be submitted by the end of this week, Learning Activities will be fully reviewed and completed, with the first open source book created by an MA LEAD class complete as well.

Congratulations to you all. This marks a major milestone in your academic career and your personal leadership development. Other researchers and learners of Strategic Leadership will benefit from your experience and wisdom as listed in the book we create. This resource will serve as a reference point for many and an inspiration to many more. Thank you for participating in LDRS 501 OL and studying the discipline of Strategic Leadership.
