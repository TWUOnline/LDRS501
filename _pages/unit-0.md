### Overview

This section of study will provide you with a foundational overview on the general texts for the course, the outcomes we will focus on for the beginning stages of course pre-reading and introductory Learning Activities. The Foundational Learning Activities for this section will introduce you to the concepts of Personal Learning and Leadership and Critical Thinking. Once you work through these activities you will have a greater grasp on the concepts presented and be prepared for the coursework ahead.

If you do not have access to these items prior to the start of the course, no worries. You can work through these concepts over the first weeks of the course to assist your developmental understanding of later concepts introduced to your strategic leadership tool kit.
