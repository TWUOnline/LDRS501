## Accessing PressBooks
For the main assignments in this course, you will need to register for an account on the TWU PressBooks site at [books.twu.ca](https://books.twu.ca). You are welcome to use the same username as you used on create.twu.ca, but please ensure that you use a different password. Keep in mind that you _must_ use your '...@mytwu.ca' email address to register for the site. Following your registration, you will receive a confirmation email in your mytwu.ca email. If you don't see this email in your inbox, please check your spam/junk folder. You will need to confirm your registration before you proceed.

Once you have registered, please contact your instructor who will add you to the correct book.
