As you are by now aware, you will require access to a WordPress site in order to participate in this course. Your best option is to use your site at create.twu.ca/[yoursitename], but you may also use a site that you use for other contexts. At minimum, you will need to use a tool that provides an RSS feed for posts and comments.

If you already have a site that you are using for the MA Lead, please use the form below to submit your RSS feed URL.

Before you do that, you will need to create a category on your site to use as the feed for this course. The category that we will use will be 'ldrs501'. When you create the category, make sure the 'slug' is 'ldrs501'.

When you submit the URL for your feed, please do so as follows:

<pre><code>https://create.twu.ca/[yoursitename]/category/ldrs501/feed
</code></pre>

The only thing you should have to do is replace [yoursitename] with the actual name of your site.

If you are using a site on wordpress.com, your url should look like the following:

<pre><code>https://[yoursitename].wordpress.com/category/ldrs501/feed
</code></pre>

If you have your own URL, it will likely be:

<pre><code>http(s)://[yoursitename].[ca/com/net]/category/ldrs501/feed
</code></pre>
