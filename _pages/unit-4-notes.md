<h3>Organizational Learning Disabilities</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>I am my position</strong> - when we confuse our position in an organization with our personal identity, every failure, criticism, success and victory is a direct reflection of our worth. We are more than our position. Getting sucked into that thinking only leaves us feeling unfulfilled and at times hamstrung by the challenges we face, where we could be an integral part of the solution versus mired in guilt and shame over organizational performance.(Senge, p. 18)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The enemy is out there</strong> - as stated earlier, we often look for scapegoats to take the blame and blame shift our responsibility to find others responsible for our failings and conversely for our success. Blame works both ways. Similarly, when we look for an enemy we can find one, but blaming them for outcomes limits our locus of control to things beyond our control affecting our organizational success. We may see challenges on the horizon, but the challenges are not the enemy. We are our own worst enemies and that enemy is usually from within. (Senge, p. 20)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The illusion of taking charge</strong> - Being proactive when challenges arise is good, but don't mistake proactive action for reflexive reaction to the challenges. Proactivity faces the difficult issues without waiting for someone else to step up to do it. Proactive is anticipatory. Waiting until the challenge arises or controls the organizational scenario before taking action is reactionary. Taking charge proactively is a positive response to impending challenges. Waiting for them to occur is not. (Senge, p. 20)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The fixation on</strong> <em><strong>(short term)</strong></em> <strong>events</strong> - when we focus our attention on short term events occurring within the organizational parameters around us versus describing longer term pattern explanations to describe a longer view of where the organization is going, we can fixate on short-term reporting and miss the long term implications to the organizational structures and processes. (Senge, p. 21)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The parable of the boiled frog</strong> - "where we do not see gradual changes, much like a frog in a pot will relax into drowsiness as its water is slowly heated." (Mister Ambiguous)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The delusion of learning from experience</strong> - "because some effects are beyond the current limits our awareness (e.g., effects in time, non-linear effects), we do not experience many of the effects of our actions." (Mister Ambiguous) This is reminiscent of Senge's law where "Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space." (p. 63) Sometimes the results of our actions occur far past the time things are put in motion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The myth of the management team</strong> - Teams spend much of their time fighting for turf, avoiding anything making them look bad, while pretending everyone is behind team strategies. (Senge, pp. 18-19) Their energies are mis-focused. Instead of focusing on solutions to the challenges at hand, they are focused inwardly toward self-protection.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Learning Activity 4. 1</h4>

<p>As you complete your reading of, <em>A Systems Thinking Primer: Seeing Organizations in Action</em> above, reflect on the following questions to help you understand your System Thinking practice in the organization you presently serve or recently served.

<ol>
<li>How does your organization, or the organization you previously served, practice Senge's fundamentals (laws) for systems thinking?

<ol>
<li>What are some of the positive outcomes from practicing these fundamentals (laws)?</li>
<li>What are some of the negative outcomes from practicing these fundamentals (laws)?</li>
<li>What one change would you introduce to the practice of these fundamentals (laws) to improve what your organization, or the organization you previously served, accomplishes through their systems practice?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How does your organization, or the organization you previously served stack up to the additional 5 laws listed above?

<ol>
<li>Reflect on the impact these additional laws have on your organization, or the organization you previously served?</li>
<li>Which of these 5 listed additional laws are most evident in your organizational practice? What are their impact?</li>
<li>What organizational changes would you introduce to mitigate the effect of a departure from these 5 additional laws in your organization or the organization your served previously?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What organizational learning disabilities have you experienced in your career?

<ol>
<li>Have any of the organizations you worked with successfully navigated from disability to ability in their systemic practice?
a) What is the most memorable success story for that change?</li>
<li>If you had the opportunity to speak into your organization to change the evident disabilities, what would you say and what processes would you suggest to turn the corner from disability to ability?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

As you complete these questions, you will have a better grasp on Systems Thinking practice and the development of Strategic Leadership principles going forward.
