##### Learning Activity for Appreciative Inquiry (AI)

For the Learning Activity in this section, you will conduct an AI interview with your team (2-3 people), following the instructions outlined below.

* Gather together as a team (via Skype, Zoom, Google Hangouts, FaceTime, etc.) and ask each other the following questions.
* Record your answers to one another to compare and discuss your answers afterwards.

Suggested questions for interviews_(adapted from OESC Trustee Professional Development Program)_:

1. What motivated you to enter your present career?
1. What do you value most about being involved in your present career pursuits and the larger mission this represents?
2. Think back to your most significant leadership experience you have had in your career.
1. A time when you felt really alive, engaged, and proud of yourself and your performance? Describe the experience.
2. What strengths surrounded you?
3. What values were at play?
4. How has this experience influenced you in your role today?
3. Think back to a successful project or activity that was particularly satisfying in terms of teamwork or a collective achievement. A moment or period where you felt you made a real difference because of the collaboration among the group.
1. Describe that time.
2. What are the one or two reasons you felt engaged?
3. What contributed to this being a peak experience?
4. What made the team effective?
5. What do you think was your own most valuable contribution to the team?
6. What does your present employer do to promote these types of experiences?
4. If you could make three wishes you, the people you work with and your present employer to evolve to their full potential as a team, what would those wishes be?
5. What single small change can you make to have the biggest impact in improving your work environment right now?

**Whole Group Sharing and Storytelling**

After your group’s interviews are complete, share your responses with one another and make meaning out of what you've learned.

Follow up questions for discussion:

1. What did you find most surprising in your interviews?
2. What are your team’s greatest strengths (as gleaned from your interviews with one another)?
3. What are some of the key factors for a successful team you possess together? (List as many as you discover)
4. What values do you have in common? (List at least three, but no more than 5)
5. What are the group’s aspirations for this team as a result of what you've learned about each other through the interview process?
6. how will you incorporate what you've learned from this exercise into the team practices required to publish the Open Source Strategic Leadership Book required in completing this course?

Once you answer these questions, record them somewhere to refer to them throughout your work together and remind you of the important concepts and principles you've discovered in this process.
