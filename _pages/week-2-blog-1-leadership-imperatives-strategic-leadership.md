<h2>Week 2 - BLOG 1 - Leadership Imperatives &amp; Strategic Leadership</h2>
For this first post, you will respond according to your stream choices.

Using the Hughes, Beatty and Dinwoodie text (pp. 52 – 103), all pre- and Week 1 reading for this course, the <a href="https://books.twu.ca/monograph/">MA LEAD LEADERSHIP MONOGRAPH 2018 – Monograph 2 - Transformational Servant Leadership</a> –and the “Personal Learning and Leadership” and “Critical Thinking” Learning Activities from Week 1.

Reflect on the importance of the tools and thinking associated with servant and strategic leadership for organizational development in today’s business, health care, educational, nonprofit and Christian Ministry organizations, by answering the following stream specific questions: [pick your stream focus only]
<ol>
 	<li>How does Transformational Servant Leadership affect the development of strategic leadership directions in a business, health care, educational, nonprofit or Christian ministry organization?</li>
 	<li>What are the benefits of keeping servant leadership as a central focus in the use of the strategic leadership principles outlined in the principles of Strategic Leadership in the “Personal Learning and Leadership” Learning Activity, the tools outlined in the Hughes, Beatty and Dinwoodie text (pp. 52 – 103) and the various pre and week 1 reading materials in a business, health care, educational, nonprofit or Christian ministry organization?</li>
 	<li>What critical thinking principles outlined in the “Critical Thinking” Learning Activity from Week 1, are important for tying the principles of critical thinking with transformational servant leadership principles in the development of organizational strategies in a business, health care, educational, nonprofit or Christian ministry organization?</li>

 	<li>Provides rich dialogue in the learning process.</li>
 	<li>Provides the opportunity for building a supportive subculture of encouragement for one another through shared ideas and challenging discourse.</li>
 	<li>Allows participants to focus on addressing the questions at hand fully and completely. Disagreeing and challenging one another based on the material under review and investigation so as to stimulate and edifying one another through the pure pursuit of the best information within the best framework of discussion – forum discussion questions (DQ).</li>
</ul>
<em><strong>Substantive participation may include (among other things):</strong></em>
<ul>
 	<li>Providing and developing a new thought, idea, or perspective.</li>
 	<li>Citing an experience or example of what we are learning and showing how it applies.</li>
 	<li>Adding a new twist on a perspective.</li>

 	<li>Restating what has already been said (unless there is a direct purpose in doing so).</li>
 	<li>Disrespectfully disagreeing.</li>
 	<li>Pat answers that are not thought - provoking</li>
</ul>
<em><strong>Below are examples of how to stimulate your thinking and the thinking of others when looking for new and unique approaches to a line of study or argumentation.</strong> </em>
<ul>
 	<li>What would happen if we looked at this from this perspective...?</li>
 	<li>Other times it may be helpful to ignore the obvious and look into the less obvious answers to the question...</li>
 	<li>My consideration leads me to believe that...what is your experience with this?</li>
 	<li>You might want to approach this from this point of view...</li>
 	<li>Is it possible that...</li>
 	<li>Would you consider a different view...?</li>
 	<li>Maybe...</li>
 	<li>Possibly...</li>
 	<li>Sometimes...</li>
 	<li>I'm wondering if...</li>
