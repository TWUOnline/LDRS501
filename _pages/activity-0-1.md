#### Definitions of Leadership

&gt;The only definition of a leader is someone who has followers. (Drucker, P. (1996). Leader of the Future. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.)

&gt;Leadership is influence - nothing more, nothing less. (Maxwell, J. (1998). The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership.

&gt;The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve. Then the conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. The best test is: do those served grow as persons; do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants? - Greenleaf, R. (1991). The servant as leader. Indianapolis: The Greenleaf Center.

#### Systemic Leadership
![](/assets/Presentation1_edited.jpg)

In Systemic Leadership Develop In Systemic Leadership Development (1999) by Kevin Liu, he suggests systemic leadership requires a process 'that takes place over time and involves a variety of integrated activities.' (p. 12). Reviewing the diagram above, we see this observation born out as it reflects systemic leadership including the need for a balanced approach using strategic leadership principle, supervisory leadership practice and personal leadership development in the effective integration of a systemic leadership development principles and practice and has 'an impact on the effectiveness of leadership development in the organization.' (p. 12)

#### Personal Leadership

The first and central aspect of Systemic Leadership is Personal Leadership. Personal Leadership requires the leader to be self aware of their strengths and limitations. Taking the time to manage themselves well and develop themselves as effective personal expressions of leadership strength.

To do this, it is important the leadership development include the demonstration of character in their personal practice and leadership philosophy. It is the strength of self governance in a complex and challenging world around us that requires every leader to pay attention to establishing the the finer details of Self-Awareness, self management, self development and demonstrated character. Application of these principles in their personal leadership development will set the stage for demonstrable success in their leadership development.

#### Supervisory Leadership

Supervisory Leadership Practice identifies the necessity to foster the development of others to create healthy organizations and build effective communication structures. These practices set the foundation for building effective functional and cross functional teams that build effective partnerships and networks within, across and beyond the organization. Investing heavily in others, focusing on development principles for healthy organizational structure and effective communication mobilizes functional and practical knowledge within the organization so communication maximizes across the organization and deepens in communicating the important issues effecting the organization as a whole.

Supervisory Leadership Practice also navigates the socio-political environments inherent in organizations where people interact on a variety of levels and for a variety of multi-leveled purposes. To address the needs represented within a complex and broad based environment, organizations need to develop ongoing benefit for the organization and the people within it. This requires organizations to make a firm commitment, to not simply address needs and focus on responding to those needs, but 'organizations need to invest in developing the leadership skills of supervisors' as well.

#### Strategic Leadership

Strategic Leadership is about setting direction and aligning decisions with organizational mission (who you are), vision (where you are going) and values (how you are going to get there). Additionally, startegic leadership focuses organizational structures and resources toward establishing evidence of organizational progress along the way. Intention, theory and planning go nowhere if evidence of progress does not accompany the process.

Evidence sets the course for future decision making beyond the plans and the theory. Evidence helps us align decisions, assess progress and evaluate success in fulfilling the strategic plan developed for the organization. It also allows the organization to demonstrate their success in fulfilling the plans and theories attached to their strategy, while encouraging critical thinking in evaluation and assessment of the process and processes along the way.

In many areas:
&gt;"strategy has been narrowed to a competitive game plan, divorcing it from a firm's larger sense of purpose; the CEO's unique role as arbiter and steward of strategy has been eclipsed; and the exaggerated emphasis on sustainable competitive advantage has drawn attention away from the fact that strategy must be a dynamic tool for guiding the development of a company over time" (Montgomery, 2008).

To the contrary, effective strategic leadership encourages and supports innovation and allows the organization, its component parts and its people to innovate at multiple levels to protect organizational identity and to help the entire organization move toward a future orientation based on the establish mission, vision and values the organization hold and protect it as it moves toward a future orientation of process, product and people.

Strategic Leadership is the vehicle organizations can use to champion and orchestrate change by its commitment to the strategic processes adopted and the protections initiated.

The full value of strategic leadership may not be realized in practical terms, however, until we expand its dimensions to reflect the real complexities of choices which leaders make. Strategies 'shaped by the way in which strategic leaders perceive the business environment, identify strategic issues, select key ones and attend to them by allocating their time and resources at their hand to address them.' (Najmaei, A., Quazi, Z., &amp; Behnia, M. 2017) Engaging the whole organization allows leaders to move from static leaders to strategic leaders as they enagage and involve plans, processes and people to accomplish the strategies envisioned for a positive and dynamic organizational future.

#### Versatile Leadership

Versatile leadership allows us to navigate the many challenges attached to the strategic leadership process. Without versatility, many leaders can get stuck repeating ideas and stagnating in challenges because they are unable to see beyond the patterns set in their own minds or within the restrictive practices of their organizational structures.

The chart below allows for a snapshot of you versatility as it relates to Strategic leadership. Look at the chart and answer the questions below to help you gain a present snapshot of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> present versatility practice.

_(Record your answer somewhere you can access it for future reference in Assignments and BLOG material for this course)_

#### Leadership Versatility Chart

1. Where do you fit on this chart? Why?
2. Where do you go when you’re under stress? Why do you think you go there?
3. Where do your leaders fit on this chart? Why?
4. What could you accomplish, knowing this information? How will it help you improve your versatility in your organization?

#### Locus of Control

When we use the term 'locus of control' in Strategic Leadership we mean the extent the organization or leadership believes 'they have power over events in their lives.' (Fournier, 2018) If a person or organization has an internal locus of control, they believe they (personally or corporately) 'can influence events and their outcomes.' (Fournier, 2018) A person or organization 'with an external locus of control blames outside forces for everything.' (Fournier. 2018) Hence locus of control can indicate a strong focus on successful Strategic Leadership or defeat itself by believing that no matter what they do, outside forces will militate against them no matter what they plan. This will effect strategic planning and implementation on a broad scale.

This effects every part of the process from planning, through implementation and on through completion of strategic planning, process and outcomes since we only truly commit, to what has meaning for us personally and corporately. If an internal locus of control has personal and corporate meaning we will follow through to complete our plans to the greatest level of success because we believe we can influence all parts of the process and see the challenges within those processes to completion. We find our power, in that meaning.

Similarly, if we have an external locus of control, personally or corporately, we will be less committed to following through as we see external forces having greater bearing on the outcome than our personal efforts or commitment. The result will be half hearted efforts related to the inability to truly commit to the end result we envisions because we don't see ourselves in control of the outcomes. These controls are dictated to forces beyond our control. We lose our power in that meaning.

Locus of control affects/effects all levels of systemic leadership practice.Persons and organizations with an internal locus of control perceive themselves as having greater control over their personal or corporate leadership, than persons with a perceived external locus of control. Where is you locus of control?

##### Personal Leadership

An internal locus of control in Personal Leadership leads leader and organization to a greater self-awareness in their personal and corporate practice. They know their strengths, and hopefully their limitations, in fulfilling their strategic responsibilities as they see themselves influencing the events and outcomes of their strategic initiatives. It assist them in managing themselves, self aware development and the demonstration of character, since everything they do is committed to personal influences and development of influence in their personal and corporate circumstances. This leads to a highly self aware personal leadership that benefits personal and organizational development throughout the processes related to the planning and implementation of strategic initiatives they are part of; leading to greater mastery of skills related to strategy and fulfillment.

With any focus on mastery of skills, mastery brings a sense of purpose and focus in fulfilling the responsibilities related to strategic outcomes. Some are empowered to the extent it appears they operate from a level akin to vision-like calling. The sense of purpose and focus outweighs any distractions or challenges they or the organization might face along the way. Mastery begets mastery and challenges are viewed as challenges to overcome, not obstacles to block progress.

For the internally locussed person or organization, the current reality, no matter how challenging, is the ally not the enemy. The internal locos commits to seeing reality more and more accurately, with an inate inquisitiveness that seeks wisdom, insight, practical and practiceable methods for completing the strategic plans and practices aimed at making what was envisioned into a reality, while providing a focus on the forces of change to move forward with.

##### Personal and Corporate Strategic Values

A properly set locus of control also effects the way individuals and organizations see their values working through the various strategic plans and initiatives aiming them toward their future. There are many values defining personal and organization effort and what they are important. The list below lists a few values appearing in various organizations.

As part of this learning activity, please look at each of the values listed below and define what each value can look like if you or your organization practice an internal or external locus of control. Answering these questions will help confirm where your personal or corporate locus of control sits, or what strategic practices need to change to develop a more complete understanding of the things helping or hindering personal or corporate systemic leadership development and strategic practice.

##### Vision

One last thought on vision.

Vision is not a magic pill; once framed is fulfilled and committed to by everyone. It’s a compass; an organizing principle people can rally around. It needs regular viewing and requires focus and commitment to the principles everyone subscribes to, to maintain it's principles and ensure everyone arrives at their strategic destination <span style="text-decoration: underline;">together</span>.

“It is not what a vision is that’s important, it’s what a vision does.”
