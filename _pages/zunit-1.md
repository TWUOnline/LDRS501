This section of study provides you with a foundational overview on general texts for the course, outcomes focus on beginning stages of course pre-reading and introductory Learning Activities. The Foundational Learning Activities for this section introduce you to concepts of Personal Learning and Leadership and Critical Thinking. Once you work through these activities you will have a greater grasp on the concepts presented and better prepared for the coursework ahead.

This overview provides important items for your review and attention as you navigate LDRS 501OL.

The first item is the reading overview allowing each participant to proceed through the texts related to this course with a focused schedule, providing opportunity to progress through the material before the course begins. Each section represents the time it will take to read through the material in 4 weeks.

The next section is entitled Outcomes. This section outlines what the course aims to accomplish and how we aim to help you accomplish the work and learning for this course. This requires intentionality on the part of the instructor and learner to observe, track and respond to course activities (graded and ungraded) to help them achieve these outcomes throughout the coursework and completion of the material therein.

Finally, you will see directions to learning Activities, specifically focused for this unit. Each weekly unit has learning activities attached and helps develop competencies and understanding associated with the practice of progressive strategic leadership habits. In this group of learning activities, you will find Learning Activities related to Personal Learning and Leadership, Critical Thinking and the development of skill specifically focused on theÂ  development and entry of the PressBooks materials we will use for publishing our open source book on Strategic Leadership Discoveries.

One final note. If you do not have access to these items prior to the start of the course, no worries. You can work through these concepts over the first weeks of the course to assist your developmental understanding of later concepts introduced to your strategic leadership tool kit.
