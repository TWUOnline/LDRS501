##### Definitions of Leadership

_The only definition of a leader is someone who has followers. _\(Drucker, P. \(1996\). Leader of the Future. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.\)

_Leadership is influence - nothing more, nothing less_. \(Maxwell, J. \(1998\). The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership.

_The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve. Then the conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. The best test is: do those served grow as persons; do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?_ - Greenleaf, R. \(1991\). The servant as leader. Indianapolis: The Greenleaf Center.
