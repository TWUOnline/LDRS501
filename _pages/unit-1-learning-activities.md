<h2>**Personal Learning and Leadership**</h2>
<em>Recommended completion of Reading Learning Notes and Learning Activities priorWeek 1 Day 1.</em>

This section provides a foundational overview on the introductory Learning Activities. The Foundational Learning Activities for this section introduce concepts of Personal Learning, Leadership and Critical Thinking. Once you work through these activities you will have a greater grasp on the concepts presented and be prepared for the coursework ahead.

If you do not have access to these items prior to the start of the course, no worries. You can work through these concepts over the first weeks of the course to assist your developmental understanding of later concepts introduced to your strategic leadership tool kit.

This section of activities focuses on learning (activities 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3) what it means to be a good leader. Your reading of the material found in Learning Activity 1.1 and Learning Activity 1.2 Learning Notes and answers to the Learning Activity Questions and Exercises benefit your preparation of Assignment 1.
