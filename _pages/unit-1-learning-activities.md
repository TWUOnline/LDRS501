<h4>Learning Activity 1.1</h4>

<h4><strong>Personal Learning and Leadership</strong></h4>

<h5>Exploring the Theory &amp; Practice of Leadership</h5>

This week we will focus learning activities toward what it means to be a good leader.

Before you read the assigned reading for this activity <em>(<span style="text-align: left;color: #333333;text-indent: 0px;letter-spacing: normal;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;text-decoration: none;cursor: text;float: none;background-color: transparent">Goleman - “Primal Leadership: Learning to Lead with Emotional Intelligence" Summary</span>), </em>take the time to personally answer the following question related to your understanding of the theory and practice of Leadership. In your present understanding and experience with Leadership:

<ol>
    <li>What attitudes, attributes and actions make a good leader?</li>
</ol>

Once you answer this question to your satisfaction,

&nbsp;

Read: Goleman - “Primal Leadership: Learning to Lead with Emotional Intelligence" Summary

[link: [https://acarthustraining.com/documents/Primal_Leadership-by_Daniel_Goleman.pdf]

Now that you've read the Goleman summary, answer the following questions to deepen your understanding of the leadership principles contained there. Personally record your answers as they relate to your discovery and reflection on the material reviewed in the Goleman summary. Your answers will have reference benefit your preparation of Assignment 1 (due on Day 7 of Week 1).

<ul>
<li>What did you like about the summary? Why?</li>
<li>What didn’t you like about it? Why?</li>
<li>What did you learn personally from the summary?</li>
<li>What are couple of key points that stand out for you in thinking about the meaning of leadership?</li>
</ul>

The Goleman summary makes the following statement:

&nbsp;

<strong>Leadership is something people grant you or don't grant you.</strong>

<ul>
<li>Who in your life have you been granted leadership from? What were the circumstances? What were the outcomes? positive? Not so positive? A disaster?</li>
<li>Did the results stop you or create a greater desire for you to lead more? Why? Why not?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Learning Activity 1.2</h4>

<h4>Critical Thinking**</h4>

<h5>Evaluating Knowledge and Research</h5>

Take a moment to read: Goleman - [“Primal Leadership: Learning to Lead with Emotional Intelligence" (https://acarthustraining.com/documents/Primal_Leadership-by_Daniel_Goleman.pdf) Book Summary

Once you read this summary, <em>(for your personal reflection and learning)</em> answer the following questions over the next week to deepen your understanding of the leadership principles contained in the Golman, et al summary.

<ul>
<li>What did you like about the summary? Why?</li>
<li>What didn’t you like about it? Why?</li>
<li>What was your greatest learning from the summary?</li>
<li>What frame of mind were you in when you read it?</li>
<li>So, what does leadership mean to you?</li>
<li>What are couple of key points that stand out for you in thinking about the meaning of leadership?</li>
</ul>

<strong>Leadership is something people either grant you or don't grant you.</strong>

<ul>
<li>Who in your life have you been granted leadership from? What were the circumstances? What were the outcomes? positive? Not so positive? A disaster?</li>
<li>Did the results stop you or create a greater desire for you to lead more? Why? Why not?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Learning Activity 1.3</h4>

<h4>Concluding Learning Activity Exercise</h4>

<em>Take the time to read through and reflect on the following principles and suggested activities during the coming week.</em>

Looking at your area of personal worldview, responsibility, discipline, organization or area of study; respond to the questions below as they relate to critical thinking:

<ol>
<li>What changes presently influence your personal worldview, area of responsibility, discipline, organization and/or area of study in the twenty- first century, and how can critical thinking help you respond to these changes?</li>
</ol>

a. Look at each area (<span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;cursor: text;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">personal worldview, responsibility, discipline, organization or area of study</span>); review the basic assumptions you are dealing with and list the changes influencing you.

<ol>
<li>How can you think more critically about the changes you listed?</li>
</ol>

a. List the critical observations you make on a separate log for future review and discussion.

<ol>
<li>Review these changes critically to broaden your personal worldview, area of responsibility, discipline, organization, area of study and practice?</p></li>
<li><p>Once you review these questions and respond to them:</p></li>
<li><p>Make a short proposal to yourself, your organization, people in your discipline or area of study to suggest changes to practices within these areas as the result of your critical review.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000">(This seems like a very bold thing to do. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the intent, but it seems like you want students to write down a critical evaluation of something within an organization and present ideas on how to correct it to their colleagues or supervisors?) </span>

<span style="color: #ff0000">DA - The choices are delineated as proposals to self, organization, OR others. The learner chooses the level of engagement they wish to pursue. As an applicable degree, the option of going as deep as they wish including addressing challenges within their own work environment etc., is relevant to a leadership degree. Otherwise, this would become a more theoretical degree with very little real time risk. The risk however is mitigated by learner choice, not instructor directive.</span>

<ol>
<li>Keep the proposal for future use in other participation activities throughout the course.</li>
</ol>
