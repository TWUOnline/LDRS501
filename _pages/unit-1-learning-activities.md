Read the article at [this link](https://create.twu.ca/ldrs501/are-you-an-example-of-diversity-practice/) and use the rubric above to assess the quality of the article. There is a feedback link at the bottom of the article.

For the purpose of this exercise, you will simply assess the written material provided in this Learning Activity and choose the appropriate letter grade from the dropdown menu.  This will be the same process for each assignment you are asked to review in this course.

Assignment grading is awarded following peer review of the materials entered into the PressBooks environment and a preliminary grading recommendation by class members, using the MA Lead and MAEL Grading Rubric. The instructor will provide a review of your success or challenges related to your grade submission activity and provide further opportunity for practice grading in future Learning Activities for this course.
