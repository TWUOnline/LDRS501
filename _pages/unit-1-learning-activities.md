<h4>Learning Activity 1.2</h4>
<h4>Critical Thinking</h4>
<em>Take the time to read through and reflect on the following principles and suggested activities during the coming week.</em>

Looking at your area of personal worldview, responsibility, discipline, organization or area of study; respond to the questions below as they relate to the discipline of critical thinking:

1. What changes presently influence your personal worldview, area of responsibility, discipline, organization and/or area of study in the twenty- first century, and how can critical thinking help you respond to these changes?

a. Look at each area (<span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;cursor: text;font-family: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,'Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">personal worldview, responsibility, discipline, organization or area of study</span>); review the basic assumptions you are dealing with and list the changes influencing YOU.

2. How can you think more critically about the changes you listed?

a. List the critical observations you make on a separate log for future review and discussion.

3. Review these changes critically to broaden your personal worldview, area of responsibility, discipline, organization, area of study and practice?

4. Once you review these questions and respond to them:

1. Make a short proposal to yourself, your organization, people in your discipline or area of study to suggest changes to practices within these areas as the result of your critical review.

&nbsp;

2. Keep the proposal for future use in other participation activities throughout the course.
