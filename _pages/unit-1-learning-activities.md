### Unit 1 Learning Activities

#### Learning Activity 1.1

#### **Personal Learning and Leadership**

##### Exploring the Theory & Practice of Leadership

As you review the ideas of personal learning and leadership, it is important you focus on the basic materials leading you to your conclusions or outcomes. Some outcomes you will want to focus on in developing your understanding of personal…

* Explore your ideas about what makes a good leader
* Think about what the literature says 
* Explore leadership theory frames
* Start to think about the question: “so how do you do this leadership thing anyway…”
* Leadership includes learning and unlearning…

##### Readings

Take a moment to read: Goleman - “Primal Leadership: Learning to Lead with Emotional Intelligence" Book Summary:

\[link: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Pz8cc0XNLWYMyB6gS2rS5LKbKYvv\_KS](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Pz8cc0XNLWYMyB6gS2rS5LKbKYvv_KS)\]

Once you read this summary, answer the following questions to deepen your understanding of the leadership principles contained in the summary.

* What did you like about the summary? Why?
* What didn’t you like about it? Why?
* What was your greatest learning from the summary?
* What frame of mind were you in when you read it?
* So, what does leadership mean to you?
  * What are couple of key points that stand out for you in thinking about the meaning of leadership?

**Leadership is something people grant you or don't grant you.**

* Who in your life have you been granted leadership from? What were the circumstances? What were the outcomes? positive? Not so positive? A disaster?
* Did the results stop you or create a greater desire for you to lead more? Why? Why not?

##### Definitions of Leadership

_The only definition of a leader is someone who has followers. _\(Drucker, P. \(1996\). Leader of the Future. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.\)

_Leadership is influence - nothing more, nothing less_. \(Maxwell, J. \(1998\). The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership.

_The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve. Then the conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. The best test is: do those served grow as persons; do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?_ - Greenleaf, R. \(1991\). The servant as leader. Indianapolis: The Greenleaf Center.

#### Systemic Leadership

![](/assets/Presentation1_edited.jpg)

#### Systemic Leadership

In Systemic Leadership DevelopIn Systemic  Leadership Development \(1999\) by Kevin Liu, he suggests systemic leadership requires a process 'that takes place over time and involves a variety of integrated activities.' \(p. 12\). Reviewing the diagram above, we see this observation born out as it reflects systemic leadership including the need for a balanced apporach using startegic leadership principle, supervisory leadership practice and personal leadership development in the effective integration of a systemic leadership development principles and practice and has 'an impact on the  effectiveness of leadership development  in the organization.' \(p. 12\)

#### Personal Leadership

The first and central aspect of Systemic Leadership is Personal Leadership. Personal Leadership requires the leader to be self aware of their strengths and limitations. Taking the time to manage themselves well and develop themselves as effective personal expressions of leadershi\[p strength.

To do this, it is important the leadership development include the demonstration of character in their personal practice and leadership philosophy. It is the strength of self governance in a complex and challenging world around us that requires every leader to pay attention to establishing the the finer details of Self-Awareness, self management, self development and demonstrated character. Appication of these principles in their personal leadership development will set the stage for demonstrable success in their leadership development.

#### Supervisory Leadership

Supervisory Leadership Practice identifies the necessity to foster the development of others to create healthy organizations and build effective communication structures. These practices set the foundation for building effective functional and cross functional teams that build effective partnerships and networks within, across and beyond the organization. Investing heavily in others, focusing on development priciples for healthy organizational structure and effective communication mobilizes functional and practical knowledge within the organozation so  communication maximizes across the organization and deepens in communicating the important issues effecting the organization as a whole.

Supervisory Leadership Practice also navigates the socio-political environments inherent in organizations where people interact on a variety of levels and for a variety of multi-levelled purposes. To address the needs represetned within a complex and broad based enviorment, organizations need to develop ongoing benefit for the oragnziation and the people within it. This requires organizations to make a frim commitment, to not simply address needs and focus on responding to those needs, but  'organizations need to invest in developing the leadership skills of supervisors' as well.

#### Strategic Leadership

Strategic Leadership is about setting direction and aligning decisions with organizational mission \(who you are\), vision \(where you are going\) and values \(how you are going to get there\). Additionally, startegic leadership focuses organizational structures and resources toward establishing evidence of organizational progress along the way. Intention, theory and planning go nowhere if evidence of progress doesn'rt accompany the process.

Evidence sets the course for future decision making beyond the plans and the theory. Evidnece he;lps us align decisions, assess progress and evaluate success in fulfiling the startegic plan developed for the organization. It also allows the organization to demonstrate their success in fulfilling the plans and theories attached to their startegy, while encouraging critical thinking in evaluation and assessment of the process and processes along the way.

In many areas: "strategy has been narrowed to a competitive game plan, divorcing it from a firm's larger sense of purpose; the CEO's unique role as arbiter and steward of strategy has been eclipsed; and the exaggerated emphasis on sustainable competitive advantage has drawn attention away from the fact that strategy must be a dynamic tool for guiding the development of a company over time" \(Montgomery, 2008\).

To the contrary, effective strategic leadership encourages and supports innovation and allows the organization, its component parts and its people to innovate at multiple levels to protect organizational identity and to help the entire organization move toward a future orientation based on the establishe mission, vision and values the organization hold and protect it as it moves toward a future orientation of process, product and people.

Startegic Leadership is the vehicle organizations can use to champion and orchestrate change by its commitment to the startegic processes adopted and the protections initiated.

The full value of strategic leadership may not be realized in practical terms, however, until we expand its dimensions to reflect the real complexities of choices which leaders make. Strategies 'shaped by the way in which strategic leaders perceive the business environment, identify strategic issues, select key ones and attend to them by allocating their time and resources at their hand to address them.' \(Najmaei, A., Quazi, Z., & Behnia, M. 2017\) Engaging the whole organization allows leaders to move from static leaders to startegic leaders as they enagage and involve plans, processes and people to accomplish the startegies envisioned for a positive and dynamic organizational future.

#### Versatile Leadership

Versatile leadership allows us to navigate the many challenges attached to the startegic leadership process. Without versaltility, many leaders can get stuck repeating ideas and stagnating in challenges beacauser they are unable to see beyond the patterns set in their own minds or within the restrictive practices of their organizational structures.

The chart below allows for a snapshot of yourversatility as it relates to Startegic leadership. Look at the chart and then answer the questions below to help you gain a present snapshot of your present versatility practice.

#### Leadership Versatility Chart

![](/assets/Presentation2_edited.jpg)

1. Where do you fit on this chart? Why?
2. Where do you go when you’re under stress? Why do you think you go there?
3. Where do your leaders fit on this chart? Why?
4. What could you accomplish, knowing this information? How will it help you improve your versatility in your organization?

#### Locus of Control

When we use the term 'locus of control' in Strategic Leadership we mean the extent the organization or leadership believes 'they have power over events in their lives.' \(Fournier, 2018\) If a person or organization has an internal locus of control, they believe they \(personally or corporately\) 'can influence events and their outcomes.' \(Fournier, 2018\) A person or organization 'with an external locus of control blames outside forces for everything.' \(Fournier. 2018\) Hence locus of control can indicate a strong focus on successful Strategic Leadership or defeat itself by believing that no matter what they do, outside forces will militate against them no matter what they plan. This will effect startegic planning and implementation on a broad scale.

This effects every part of the process from planning, through implementation and on through completion of strategic planning, process and outcomes since we only truly commit, to what has meaning for us personally and corporately. If an internal locus of control has personal and corporate meaning we will follow through to complete our plans to the greatest level of success because we believe we can influence all parts of the process and see the challenges within those processes to completion. We find our power, in that meaning.

Similarly, if we have an external locus of control, personally or corporately,  we will be less committed to following through as we see external forces having greater bearing on the outcome than our personal efforts or commitment. The result will be half hearted efforts related to the inability to truly commit to the end result we envisions because we don't see ourselves in control of the outcomes. These controls are dictated to forces beyond our control. We lose our power in that meaning.

Locus of control affects/effects all levels of systemic leadership practice.Persons and orgainzations with an internal locus of control perceive themselves as having greater control over their personal or corporate leadership, than persons with a perceived external locus of control. Where is you locus of control?

##### **Personal Leadership**

An internal locus of control in Personal Leadership leads leader and organization to a greater self-awareness in their personal and corporate practice. They know their strengths, and hopefiully their limitattions, in fulfilling their strategic responsibilities as they see themsleves influencing the events and outcomes of their strategic initiatives. It assist them in managing themselves, self aware development and the demonstration of character, since everything they do is committed to personal influences and development of influence in their personal and corporate circumstances. Thi leads to a highly self aware personal leadership that benefits personal and organizational development throughout the processes related to the planning and implementation of strategic initiatives they are part of; leading to greater mastery of skills related to startegy and fulfillment.

With any focus on mastery of skills, mastery brings a sense of purpose and focus in fulfilling the responsibilities related to strategic outcomes. Some are empowered to the extent it appears they operate from a level akin to vision-like calling. The sense of purpose and focus outweighs any distractions or challenges they or the organization might face along the way. Mastery begets mastery and challenges are viewed as challenges to overcome, not obstacles to block progress.

For the interally locused person or organization, the current reality, no matter how challenging, is the ally not the enemy. The internal locos commits to seeing reality more and more accurately, with an inate inquisitiveness that seeks wisdom, insight, practical and practiceable methods for completing the strategic plans and practices aimed at making what was envisioned into a reality, while providing a focus on the forces of change to move forward with.

##### Personal and Corporate Strategic Values

A properly set locus of control also effects the way individuals and organizations see their values working through the various strategic plans and intiatives aiming them toward their future. There are many values defining personal and organization effort and whay they are improtant. The list below lists a few values appearing in varous organizations.

As part of this learning activity, please look at each of the values listed below and define what each value can look like if you or your organization has an internal or external locaus of control. Answering these questions will help you confirm where your personal or corporate locus of control is, or what strategic practices need to change to develop a more complete understanding of the things helping or hindering the personal or corporate systemic leadership development and strategic practice.

##### Vision

One last thought on vision.

Vision is not a magic pill, when once framed is fulfilled and committed to by everyone. It’s a compass and an organizing principle people can rally around. It needs regular viewing. It requires focus and commitment to the principles and requires everyone subscribing to it to maintain it's principles and ensure everyone arrives at their strategic destination tgether.

“It is not what a vision is that’s important, it’s what a vision does.”

#### Learning Activity 1.2

#### Cr**itical Thinking**

##### Evaluating Knowledge and Research

Critical thinking is not something you do once with an issue and then drop it. It requires that we update our knowledge as new information comes in. Time spent evaluating claims is not just time well spent. It should be considered part of an implicit bargain we've all made. -_**Daniel Levitin**_

Critical thinking is a process by which we explore and analyze ideas and questions, assess the quality of the evidence, thoughts and arguments presented, and evaluate the credibility, relevance and applicability of ideas. -_**Judy Carter**_

##### Definitions

_**Disciplined thinking that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence. **_\(Dictionary.com\)

_**The mental process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusion. **_\(Dictionary.com\)

#### Traits of a Critical Thinking Mind

* Intellectual humility
  * The intellectually humble do not promote themselves above others, but let their thinking and reasoning speak for them.
* Intellectual perseverance
  * Intellectual perseverance can be described as the pursuit of the truth, or pure knowledge, even if the road to get there is arduous - _**Michael Botyarov**_
* Intellectual responsibility
  * Being rational, logical and reasonable in our thinking and belief. - _**unknown**_

#### Critical Thinking Values and Skills

When it comes to critical thinking values and skills, it is not simply enough to pat yourself on the back and determine you are a critical thinker. May have taken the stance critical thinking is the negative view of others and their faults; hence critical thinking. But critical thinking is much more.

> ... critical thinking is about taking a step back and thinking logically and carefully about the information and evidence you have, rather than believing and acting on everything you read, see and hear. \(Aveyard, Woolliams, & Sharp, p. 7\)

Critical thinking involves clarifying the questions asked. What is the context? Is the information accurate? Are the sources biased or inaccurate in their reporting of fact?

When we ask the questions, we dig deeper into the clarity we seek in trying to assess and develop the materials we research and develop for our professional responsibilities. Too often, people take the first result of the first Google search and apply it as true, when further research and asking critical questions would take them to a much different result.

In addition to clarity, it is important to critically seek accuracy in reporting your findings in your research. Taking previous assumptions is not an acceptable practice when developing ideas your research or your report professionally. Take this learning activity. This is an older presentation I developed in 2008. I could repeat the information and cut and paste the previous information. But that is simply ineffective in providing the most up to date information on the topic designed to enhance your learning. Using older information to convey present truth is akin to suggesting the best way to get across Canada is by bus. The information is accurate for a bygone era, but not relevant to the present day of air travel and the development of low cost flight options. Gathering relevant data requires up to date relevancy of materials to provide the most accurate information available at the time of reporting.

It is also part of the critical thinking to evaluate material regarding its precision as well. By identifying key assumptions \(i.e. bus travel is the best way to get across Canada\), we can address flaws in the accuracy of the information and update it with fresh understandings, statistics and report on the faulty assumptions related to the material presented. The more accurate your research, the better received and respected it will be. The critical thinker aims for the most accurate representation of their material to the intended audience.

When we identify and wrestle with assumptions, follow through with clearly research ideas and understanding of the issues, the value of critical thinking and its benefit is clear.

A further value of critical thinking is relevance. When we trace significant implications in material we review and/or research we have opportunity to test the validity of the material and discover its relevance for the present work in front of us; be it research or reporting \(which can be one and the same\). Accepting what we read without question \(often because we are pressed for time\)can cause us to miss alternative points of view or distort our findings so they bend to our view versus a clear and unbiased reflective view of relevant materials.

Critical thinking also values and practices logic in its approach. When we apply logical consideration to the materials we review, we can assess much of the material based on its logical outcomes. If the result doesn't make sense \(isn't logical\) we need to review the material and sources again to refine and confirm our conclusions before proceeding. When we apply logic and seek valid conclusions, the result of our critical thinking efforts bears fruit and becomes of greater benefit to all concerned.

#### Critical Thinking Process

When we think about being critical thinkers, we no longer look at the immediate and consequential views of what we view. We move into a larger view. A big picture view providing us with the best possible oversight of a topic. Looking at the ramifications of decisions and the possible alternatives to direct action available to us in the decision and review process for our organizations and the people we lead and serve.

The Big Picture View looks at what the person is saying? What the key points and major assertions are. Are issues/concepts clearly and accurately defined and described? Are examples pertinent? Do they substantiate the presenter’s point of view? Do you agree with the definitions and descriptions? Critically evaluating what you see, hear, read, reflect and pursue moves your view from localized and cursory to in depth a broad based.

Critical thinking also looks at the invisible components we often miss at the cursory level and looks for the implications for decisions. What will happen if moments. What will happen when? Where will this lead if we do such? Each invisible component missed in the cursory, becomes an alternative in the critical review. Taking the time to review discovery, decision and determinations helps to ensure we make the best possible decisions and provide the best information at the best time; reflective of best practices in our research and reporting.

Invisible Components of critical thinking include:

* What are the presenter’s assumptions? Are they accurate and valid?

* What values and beliefs underlie the presenter's argument?

* Do you agree with the presenter’s assumptions, values and beliefs?

* What exceptions can you think of?

Taking the time to address the questions and seek the answer increases your critically thinking acumen and reveals what was previously hidden in your thinking and your conclusions.

> Critical thinking generally incorporates active mental processes \(considering, reviewing, thinking\) that involve some breaking down or analysis of the evidence or experience within a particular context and then reaching a conclusion or outcome. \(Aveyard, Woolliams, & Sharp p. 114\)

Critical thinking urges us and allows us to:

* Scrutinize the details

  * Review information, reflect on its relevance and assess its logic.

  * Ask:

    * Is anything unclear or ambiguous?

    * Are the description and qualities accurate? \(all, none, always, never\)

    * Do the models, illustrations, charts, maps, illustrate the presenter’s point of view and add credence to his/her argument?

    * What additional information is needed?

* Assess the evidence

  * Is the information we reviewed accurate? 
  * Does it stand up under scrutiny? 
  * Is there an alternative view to what we've just found
  * Is the data clear, adequate, pertinent, convincing and complete?
  * Is the presenter’s interpretation of the data accurate, complete?
  * Are the findings universal?
  * Are stated cause and effect correctly interpreted?
  * Do other alternative explanations exist or might be discovered?
  * Are reasons sufficient and valid?
  * Is the evidence biased?

* Explore context and connections

  * Are the truths discovered contextually accurate? 
  * Do they mean the same in different and differing contexts? 
  * What are the cross disciplinary connections to what we discovered? 
  * How can it be applied in different and differing contexts?
  * Does the viewpoint fit the field and discipline?
  * Does it add something new, present contrasting viewpoints, connect to other ideas?
  * Are other points of view and data taken into account?
  * What information is missing?
  * What would you change or add to improve the work?

Critical thinking leads us to greater clarity in thinking and development of greater focus on what we research, read and discover.

The following illustration shows how we generally approach the things we observe and make the assumptions that guide us.![](/assets/The data and Experience ladder_edited.jpg)

#### Concluding Learning Activity Exercise



Looking at your area of personal worldview, responsibility, discipline, organization or area of study; respond to the questions below as they relate to critical thinking:

1. What are the changes influencing your personal worldview, area of responsibility, discipline, organization and/or area of study in the twenty- first century, and how can critical thinking help you respond to the changes affecting these areas of your life? 
   1. Look at each area; review the basic assumptions you are dealing with _\(i. e. the best way to travel across Canada is by bus\)_ and list the changes influences these areas for you.
2. How can you think more critically about these changes?
   1. List the critical observations you make on a separate log for future review and discussion.
3. Review these changes critically to broaden your personal worldview, area of responsibility, discipline, organization, area of study and practice?
4. Once you review these questions and respond to them: 
   1. Make a short proposal to yourself, your organization, people in your discipline or area of study to suggest changes to practices within these areas as the result of your critical review. 
   2. Keep the proposal for future use in other participation activities throughout the course.
