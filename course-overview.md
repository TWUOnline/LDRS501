### Strategic Leadership

#### Course Description

This course focuses on enhancing strategic awareness and practicing strategic leadership from a value based perspective. Critically evaluates strategic leadership frameworks applying to leadership contexts and realities. Participants assess strategic leadership thinking and apply leadership scenarios for leading, transforming and making sense of strategic complexities to meet leadership imperatives.

Strategic Leadership focuses on the changing environments around us as they relate to organizational challenges and developing strategies from within existing frameworks to provide specific and nuanced responses to the challenges organizations face in real time. The practice, process and outcomes are as unique as the person/organization framing them. Diluting the process to a one size fits all is a recipe for failure and an assurance your organization will experience minimal success in its strategic practice and future outcomes.

Tis course does not take generic processes and apply them randomly to get the results everyone gets. Your results will be as specific and focused as you need them to be, for meeting the strategic challenges required for leading your organization.
