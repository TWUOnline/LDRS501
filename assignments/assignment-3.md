# Assignment 3

## **WEEK 7 – TEAM ASSIGNMENT 2**

### **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP TEAM PROJECT \(15%\)**

### **STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS – Sustain, Delete, Rethink and Add-Innovate**

#### **Team submissions Due Sunday June 17 at 23:59 PST**

This assignment is intended as an applied learning experience using SWOT in conjunction with either a _**‘brain storming’**_ process or the newer approach of **‘brain swarming’** to develop your information.

SWOT analysis is a long standing strategic process used successfully by various and varying organizations for many years. \(see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVwQNOIu808)\)

SWOT Analysis however, is in declining use as are **Brain storming** processes \(see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K8W4ooygUU&list=PLSK-oAscPW29NnHjI2MviD8O9ZC04ta0v)\) , and its underlying methodology often criticized as contributing to **group think**. \(see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMKK17EWXks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMKK17EWXks)\)

Review of these principles allows learners to gain experience with methodologies critical in developing an effective strategic leadership toolkit.

A newer process focuses attention on a Sustain, Delete, Rethink, Add, Innovate process based on a shift of thinking process called **Brain swarming** and represents a different approach to the discipline of strategic thinking. \(see [https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work](https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)\)

Brain swarming asserts it is unproductive to gather everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment that is not necessarily suitable for everyone. While **Brain Storming** is the practice of sharing ideas while withholding judgment, **Brain Swarming** asks:

#### **Why do we need to talk in the first place?**

**Brain Swarming** asserts it is unproductive to gather everyone in a room to force a solution in an environment that might not be suitable for everyone.

How brain swarming works:

* Learning outcomes are defined, then refined into cluster groups.
* Inputs are sought from each team – there are limits on the number of inputs in each cluster so strategic choices are required by each team
* Your input becomes pieces to a puzzle joining various contributions into strategic perspectives the team can sort. \(see [https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work](https://hbr.org/video/3373616535001/brainswarming-because-brainstorming-doesnt-work)\)

#### **Assignment Parameters**

Using Lepsinger's 6 Bridge Building Principles in "Closing the Execution Gap \(2010\) and Hughes, Beatty and Dunwoody's assessment tools for assessing organizational capacity for change in Becoming a Strategic Leader \(2014\) from Exhibits 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 \(pp. 130-133\) and the AAR six step process outlined on p. 134;

Assess the suggested strategies developed for the organization reviewed in your SWOT analysis of the organization chosen to determine the anticipated success or failure of the changes suggested for the organization's future practice and suggested strategies determined for change in the organization.

You can use a brainstorming or brain swarming approaches for reviewing the questions in the SWOT analysis. _\(Whichever tool your team uses is acceptable as long as the team is comfortable with the tool chosen – both are supplied for your review – direct any questions to me in the Q & A section of the course page if you experience any challenges with the process.\)_

Each team must submit the results of a SWOT analysis for an organization in line with the requirements mentioned above. The analysis will use Lepsinger’s \(2010\) 6 Bridge Builders \(pp. 25-203\) and the questions contained in Hughes, Beatty and Dinwoodie \(2014\) - Exhibits 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 \(pp. 130-133\) and the AAR six step process outlined on p. 134; to determine the success or failure of the organization to apply the changes discovered by the team in the SWOT Process.

The TEAM LEAD will assign all materials the team reviews and is responsible for submitting the finalized PPT or Prezi for grading.

The ppt or Prezi must include descriptive notes where the graphics do not explain the material fully and include a clear reference page citing all reference materials used in the presentation.

#### **THE TEAM WILL:**

1. Select an organization to review using a SWOT analysis.\* _\(The organization can be fictional or actual that team members have awareness of.\)_
   1. For the purpose of time the choice and identity of the organization needs completion by the team for the middle of Week 3 _\(October 11\)_
2. The team will develop their SWOT Questions for the end of week 4 _\(October 22\)_
3. The team will review the 4 quadrants by the end of Week 5 _\(October 29\)_
4. Results compiled - by Week 6 _\(November 5\)_
5. TEAM LEAD will post PPT/Prezi/Video\*\* Presentation and the Reference List to the assigned Drop Box by the Week 8 due date _\(November 19\)_

**\*NOTE:** _As the application process for human study research is required to be submitted to REB on campus prior to conducting interviews where personal information is compiled and disseminated, the information you glean for your organizational review will need to be compiled from publicly available research or personal information shared by a team member. \(TWU REB Policy 3.1 a&b\) There are many organizations with excellent public profiles for you to choose from. Research well, focus clearly and gather information intentionaLly._

**\*\*NOTE**_: PPT is a maximum of 21 slides \(don’t forget the notes pages are usable\), PREZI’s will be a maximum of 60 stations \(use separate notes to explain what the visual presentations miss\), or Video 5 minutes max \(make a YouTube video, upload it and send only the link to the Virtual Collegium \(for viewing\). All references must appear on the credits page or submitted as an APA compliant WORD doc to the assignment drop box\)._
